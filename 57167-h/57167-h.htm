<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>That the present edition of “<cite>My Japanese
Wife</cite>” has been called for is a source
of satisfaction to the writer. Of previous
editions some 60,000 copies have been sold,
and it is hoped the present version will
prove none the less acceptable from the
fact that the story has been revised and a
considerable amount of new matter added
to it.</p>

<p>The author has done this to enable the
final form of the novel to be that in
which it was originally written, but
which for purposes of first publication in
a particular series it was necessary to
alter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p>Mousmé is leaning over me as I write.
Mousmé, a butterfly from a far Eastern
land, her dress of apricot silk, with a magenta
satin <i lang="ja">obi</i> (sash), a blot of bright
colour in the dulness of my English study.
My Mousmé! with Dresden-china tinted
cheeks, and tiny ways; playing at life, as
it always seems to me, with the dainty
grace of Japan, that idealised doll’s-house
land. Mousmé, who goes with me everywhere,
whose <i lang="fr">bizarre</i> clothing attracts
notice to her even when the delicately
pretty face of a child-woman with innocent,
soft eyes and finely arched brows is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
hidden behind the ever-present fan, which
she draws from the ample folds of her <i lang="ja">obi</i>.</p>

<p>My friends at Nagasaki told me that I
was foolish to marry a mousmé, especially
as I was to return to England so soon.</p>

<p>“Why not hire one for the remaining
period of your stay?” suggested Kotmasu,
who dined with me at my little toy-like
villa so often that he began to offer advice
as a matter of course. “Misawa would
find you a mousmé,” he continued, “whom
you could put off as easily as an old glove.
A real mousmé, not a <i lang="ja">geisha</i> girl with a
past, an ambiguous present, and a who-knows-what
future.”</p>

<p>Others of my friends laughed till they
made the paper partitions of my house
shiver like the strings and parchment of
the <i lang="ja">samisen</i>. “You will tire of her,” said
they.</p>

<p>Yet others with a knowing smile, “She
will tire of you. They are all the same.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Butterflies that change with the day.
Moths which the night-air of reality blows
to pieces.”</p>

<p>But I would not be advised.</p>

<p>Advice is so cheap one seldom values it.
Besides, had I not lived in Japan long
enough to know what I was doing?</p>

<p>The only soul on earth who could have
deterred me was Lou, that terrible sister
who, before I had come out East, had
formulated so many plans for my “settling
down!” Who had selected—much as she
would have a bonnet or a dress, and with
almost as much care—several nice girls,
any one of whom she had thought would
make me a good wife. But Lou was
thousands of miles away—how I revelled
in that fact!—and would only be made
wise after the event. Now as Mousmé is
looking over me as I write—she knows as
much English as I Japanese—I must set
down how I met her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>It was one night at the Tea-house
(<i lang="ja">chaya</i>) of the Plum Grove. I had come
up there with Kotmasu. The <i lang="ja">djins</i>, bare-legged,
panting runners, had rushed us
along in the inevitable <i lang="ja">rikishas</i> to this
suburban resort up the hillside.</p>

<p>The town, illuminated with thousands
of lanterns hung outside even the smallest
of the houses, became, as we climbed upwards
to our destination, a fairyland of
colour and delight, as it always did at
nightfall. In the silent waters of the harbour
this gay scene was repeated by reflection
in the glassy surface.</p>

<p>Upwards we went, Kotmasu and I; he
calling to me every now and then, as his
<i lang="ja">rikisha</i>, spider-like phantom of a vehicle,
was momentarily lost in the gloom to reappear
just as suddenly in the patch of
light thrown by some paper lantern swinging
to mark the gateway of a villa retired
from the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>A Japanese night! Balmy, delicious;
intoxicating with the odour of the flowers
which came sweeping down on us in the
breath of the mountain air, or creeping in
varied scents over the hedges or toy-like
fences of the gardens we passed; so soothing
that Kotmasu, more used to the jolting
of the <i lang="ja">rikisha</i> than I, felt drowsy, and left
off talking.</p>

<p>The sounds of the town, the music of
guitars or <i lang="ja">samisens</i> being played in the
tea-houses or gaming-houses, had grown
gradually indistinct and distant. Now
scarcely any noise save the whirring chirp
of the cicalas broke the still, sweet-scented
air.</p>

<p>Soon we reached our goal, where I was
fated to meet and be enslaved by the
charms of Hyacinth—for so Mousmé was
called. Above us, an inky mass against
an indigo sky starred with points of light,
rose the mountain, tree-clad, as I knew, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
whose sides gleamed here and there the
beams of light emanating from paper lanterns
or paper-shuttered casements, marking
the presence of houses or huts deep-set
among the fantastic greenery of the woods.</p>

<p>“Will the sir get out?” exclaimed my
<i lang="ja">djin</i> respectfully, panting with the exertion
of the ascent. I climbed down into
the darkness, almost falling over Kotmasu,
who had already alighted, laughing at our
adventure.</p>

<p>Beside us, just where our <i lang="ja">rikishas</i> had
drawn up, was the ghostly gateway
marking the entrance to the tea-garden,
which lay at the top of a narrow path
sloping upward; this wooden gateway
painted Indian red and white, the white
timbers showing like some spectral skeleton
in the dusky gloom.</p>

<p>“Up there, sir,” pointed my <i lang="ja">djin</i>, who
bowed low whilst acting as spokesman.</p>

<p>Telling them not to wait, because we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
should, as Kotmasu put it, “be many
hours,” we two entered the gateway, which
marked the line of the palings of bamboo,
and made our way up the narrow flower-bordered
path to the <i lang="ja">chaya</i>.</p>

<p>Through an avenue of sweet odours we
walked, the mingled scent of tea-roses,
gardenias and the soil making the atmosphere
almost cloying with sweetness.</p>

<p>This wonderful garden of the tea-house,
with its miniature ponds, bridges and
grottoes, now all hidden in the darkness,
was mysterious and even uncanny as all
Eastern gardens are at dusk.</p>

<p>Set back a little from the path were serried
ranks of sentinel-like sunflowers, of
whose black, vacant faces, yellow-fringed,
I felt conscious, staring at me out of the
gloom.</p>

<p>A turn of the path and we were in a
fairyland, whose existence none a hundred
yards off would have suspected. Light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
for darkness; sounds in the place of
silence.</p>

<p>We made our way beneath the paper
lanterns of many hues, suspended in mid-air
by slender, undistinguishable cords:
dragons, green, yellow or red, as their
bellying background of variegated paper
demanded or the taste of the artist dictated,
are there; and cats, monstrous and
eccentric-limbed, such as provoke memories
of such things drawn on slates in childhood’s
days.</p>

<p>There is a flood of yellow, orange, white
and blue light on the paths and flower-beds
stocked thick with asters, zinnias,
strange fringed-edged ragged carnations
and chrysanthemums, whilst bushes
clipped and trained into fantastic shapes
form climbing stations, so to speak, for
huge and lesser convolvuli.</p>

<p>Through the paper shutters of the house
itself stream more light and sounds of
music played upon the <i lang="ja">samisen</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Kotmasu, an <i lang="fr">habitué</i>, knocks upon the
lacquer panel of the big door, which is
speedily drawn back in its grooved-way.
The wife of Takeakira the proprietor appears
at the opening, a queer little old
woman, silhouetted, with all the ugliness
which so often comes with age, against a
background of light; behind her a pretty
attendant mousmé, just as if she was a
figure taken from a vase. Both bow so
low on recognising visitors that their faces
touch the floor, and then they take off our
shoes.</p>

<p>The mousmé conducts us upstairs, along
a narrow passage, over the floor of which
is stretched, stainless and wrinkleless, a
matting of bamboo fibre, into a room which
is bare and clean-looking almost to desperation
and chilliness.</p>

<p>“<i lang="ja">Shibaraku</i>,” says the mousmé, addressing
us both with a smile of welcome, as
she leads the way, which speech Kotmasu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
tells me is meant for him, as well as the
smile and show of white teeth between
pretty red lips. Perhaps it is, “What a
long time since you have been here!” being
obviously inapplicable to me on a first
visit.</p>

<p>The paper walls of the room—spotlessly
clean—into which we are eventually ushered
with a great amount of ceremonious
bowing, are just like those in my own
little doll’s-house of a villa down in the
outskirts of Nagasaki—mere sliding panels,
each one in its own ingenious groove.
And these by some wonderful process all
fit into one another and mysteriously disappear.
It is here we have to wait; in
this bare room, with its long verandah
running in front of it, from which “The
Garden of a Thousand Lights,” as its proprietor
loved to call it, can be seen; and
in the daytime the harbour, an irregular
segment of the ocean beyond, calm, green,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
but animated by the presence of sampans—gondola-like,
graceful, with indigo beaks
and queer odd-shaped cabins—junks with
sails of matting, traders of all nations,
hulking colliers, and here and there a man-of-war
belonging to a friendly or unfriendly
Power.</p>

<p>We are given squares of matting on
which to squat, in lieu of chairs, by the
ever-smiling mousmé, who then stands
mute, awaiting our orders.</p>

<p>“Are there no other guests?” asks Kotmasu,
with a quick glance at the little
standing figure.</p>

<p>“Yes, several,” replies the mousmé,
smiling. And, as though to verify her
words, and dispel Kotmasu’s enigmatic and
somewhat incredulous smile, we hear unmistakable
sounds of hilarity arising from
the room beneath our feet, and from a distant
chamber on our right.</p>

<p>“But,” continued our mousmé, glancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
curiously at me, and adjusting her <i lang="ja">obi</i> of
some flower-sprinkled material with minute
care, “the English sirs mostly like to
feast alone.” Such was, at all events,
Kotmasu’s translation of the remark.</p>

<p>Kotmasu orders our repast; it is to be
ultra-Japanese.</p>

<p>Sometimes at my own villa I regale him
and seek to revive my own gastronomic
memories with pseudo-European fare,
which he pretends to like, but in reality
loathes because of its immense portions—in
the estimation of my Japanese chef; at
these I always laugh because the meal
seems so grotesquely disproportionate to
one’s needs—in Japan.</p>

<p>There is another reason than that so
naïvely given—“the English sirs mostly
care to feast alone”—by the almond-eyed
mousmé; and Kotmasu explains it when
the dainty little figure has disappeared
through a sliding door to execute our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
orders. I must not set it down here.
What is common and picturesque in
Japan, is so unspeakable in English.
Kotmasu sits silent, thinking of the meal
to come, perhaps, in which “teal duck,”
raw spinach, raw shrimps, and even dog,
were to find a place—all save the first,
thank goodness, in minute proportions.</p>

<p>The sounds of revelry by night went
on all the while that Kotmasu and I
waited, coming to us softened and indistinct
through chinks in the floor and
through the paper panels forming the
walls of the room—the voices of women
and the accompanying music of the <i lang="ja">samisen</i>,
with its note of sadness. Then we
heard the muffled sounds of the feet of
<i lang="ja">geishas</i> dancing, in their shoeless, gliding
motions.</p>

<p>The strains of the monotonous music,
punctuated with Japanese phrases, echoed
in the bare passage outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Kotmasu got up and opened the door of
grey paper leading on to the verandah,
which had black and vermilion storks in
flight across its two long panels.</p>

<p>We stepped out.</p>

<p>I for the first time; for Kotmasu I cannot
answer. The sounds of the music became
clearer, because the others had also
slid back their paper doors, perhaps so
that the sweet-scented air of the garden
might enter, or a whiff of fresh night-wind
from off the mountain come in to
cool the breathless <i lang="ja">geishas</i>.</p>

<p>The garden of a thousand lights, with
its fountain of doll-like dimensions, in the
lower and larger basin of which swim
gold, silver and copper-hued fish, lies just
beneath our verandah, and, after an artificial
plateau, runs away down-hill into the
darkness, following each side of the narrow,
flower-edged path.</p>

<p>The paper lanterns with painted, bulging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
sides, some round, some like two mortar-boards
of college days which had taken
each other into partnership, some like
elongated helmets of a Uhlan, and others
like monstrous fishes, birds, or reptiles
swimming and floating in ether, diffuse a
soft, subdued light. A puff of air makes
the whole lot swing to and fro so wildly,
with a rustle of their paper emptiness,
that Kotmasu and I are set wondering idly
whether an immense lantern, meant to represent
a gold-fish with vermilion fins and
black vertebra, which is obviously troubled
in its interior, will not flare up and hang,
a blackened skeleton, amidst its gay companions.</p>

<p>A white cat flits ghost-like and silent-footed
across the path and vanishes down
it in answer to a dissonant call of its fellow,
and in that moment the disaster
happens. The gold-fish, which has regarded
us with vacant vermilion-rimmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
eyes, is instantly a mass of flame, and
then, in another instant, a blackened travesty
of a fish.</p>

<p>There are trees in the garden, also fantastic;
green grotesques tended and trained
with the minute care of a singular taste.
There are little nooks, little rockeries in
which strange toads and reptiles hide in
the fresh moss and darkened crannies, coming
out occasionally, sometimes to slip
unawares or through ungainliness into
miniature lakes—toy ponds—frightening
the lazy gold-fish and making the water-lily
buds and blossoms nod and curtsey in
the ripples caused by their immersion.</p>

<p>The moon is rising, and the wall of
blackness which begins where the lights
of the garden end becomes gradually less
inky, till at last, as the moon tops the
mountain ridge, like some laborious and
persistent climber, and floods the harbour
with her pale, silver light, the vastness of
the scene is disclosed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Down below in the streets of the town
the lights of art are paling in that of
Nature’s lantern. The harbour is a huge
replica of the glass of frosted silver I
bought last week in a curio-shop for twenty
<i lang="ja">yen</i>. The ships at anchor are mere spectres,
narrow lines of ink, some of them
with dots of light along their sides; the
shadow of the hills, over which the moon
peeps with cold, white face, just the breath
on the glass as when a woman looks too
closely into it.</p>

<p>The sounds of singing and dancing appear
fewer now it is less sombre. Why
does darkness exaggerate noise?</p>

<p>A steamer is going out; it is the mail, a
thin thing like the match P. and O. boats
I often swam in a bowl when a boy—the
lights of her saloon mere glow-worms at
this distance. But my companion must
have seen all this many times before. Of
course he has. And being more interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
just now in “teal-duck” than the night
side of Nature, he vanishes through the
opened doorway, and I hear him drumming
with his stockinged heel upon the floor
to summon the mousmé.</p>

<p>“<i lang="ja">Ayakou!</i>” sings out Kotmasu, who has
sung “Hi! hi!” till there came an answering
voice from below.</p>

<p>I leave my post on the verandah and
enter the room, and along the passage at
the back comes the sound of a mousmé
pattering barefoot, her quick, short steps
making a gentle thud, thud on the matting.</p>

<p>The panel door is thrust aside, and our
attendant enters with a bow, and many
ingenious excuses for the delay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p>Kotmasu and I are seated; and on the
floor before us our attendant mousmé
places a wonderful bowl of seaweed soup—a
dainty thing with sprays of chrysanthemums
adorning its china-blue sides, the
white-blue that you see in the eyes. To
this soup I am used, and also to beans enshrined
in sugar, and little fish equally
astray from their proper element; but to
the live fish, quivering its last quiver, perhaps,
I cannot become accustomed, and
even to watch Kotmasu—humane man in
ordinary—placing the chop-stick impaled
morsels in his mouth is almost too much
for my still Western stomach. Of the
“teal duck” and prawns I partake largely,
making the mousmé laugh—so infectious
are the emotions in this land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
make-believe—by pretending to swallow the latter
whole. I am not yet quite used to the
chop-sticks, and occasionally fail ludicrously
to spit my morsels, making both
my companion and the mousmé roar, the
latter clapping her pretty small hands with
delight. But I am not annoyed; I have
yet to see the foreigner who handles these
strange implements better.</p>

<p>“It is not so easy as it looks,” I say in
excuse; and Kotmasu, with recollections of
far worse performances than mine, agrees
with me.</p>

<p>Our little dinner of toy-like viands,
served by the soft-footed little mousmé, is
gone through with fitting ceremoniousness,
but at last it is finished, and Kotmasu is so
pleased with the repast, that he is in no
hurry for the long walk back to the town.</p>

<p>“There are generally pretty <i lang="ja">geishas</i>
here,” he said to me, when we had lighted
the ridiculous little pipes—mere tubes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
silver, with a pigmy bowl at the end—which
the mousmé had now brought us.</p>

<p>The jars placed before each of us, filled
with sweet-scented tobacco of the colour
of tow, and so “mild” that a baby might
have inhaled its smoke; the spittoons and
the porcelain stove containing the glowing
embers at which we lit our pipes; always
made me smile—they were so toy-like and
minute—and long for my briar and honey-dew.</p>

<p>“Yes?” I replied interrogatively between
the puffs. “Shall I tell Gazelle”
(for such was the mousmé’s poetic name)
“to summon one?” he continued.</p>

<p>Why not? I had seen them many times
before, it was true; but we were in no
hurry, and they were always graceful,
dainty, pretty and amusing—at least the
best of them were, and no one troubled
about those who were not.</p>

<p>“Is there dancing?” Kotmasu asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Gazelle, who had stood regarding us with
a friendly look during our colloquy.</p>

<p>“Yes. Some of the best <i lang="ja">geishas</i> from
the town are here in the house. There is
a party below, the most noble young Sen”
(we had never heard of him, but no matter—it
was but the mousmé’s way of describing
a good customer, who had probably
kissed her pretty Dresden-china face and
given her half a <i lang="ja">yen</i> for the privilege) “is
here with his most noble companions from
the big ship. They have brought the
<i lang="ja">geishas</i> with them. They are dancing
now. Listen! But doubtless I can get
one to come for the pleasure of Mr. the
English sir.”</p>

<p>We nodded assent, and with a smile Gazelle
vanished.</p>

<p>We heard the sound of the pad, pad of
her footsteps retreating along the passage,
then a sudden cessation of the noises in the
room below, as we could imagine her opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the door. The zing, zing of the <i lang="ja">samisen</i>
suddenly ceased, and the girls’ voices
stopped their monotonous, chant-like song.
Then came the sound of other voices seemingly
in argument; then a recommencement
of the previous noises as before our
mousmé had interrupted the proceedings.</p>

<p>Then we hear Gazelle returning.</p>

<p>“Alone?” I suggest to my companion,
who merely shakes his head and laughs,
replying, “No. The <i lang="ja">geisha</i> is light of
foot—a butterfly, coming without sound,
the heavy circling flutter of her fan
like the beatings of the wings of the
great grey moths outside there in the
garden.”</p>

<p>The footsteps of Gazelle came on, and
then halted outside. There was no
knocking at the door. How can one
beat upon fragile paper panels with one’s
fist? And the usual little knocker of
brass, a grotesque lizard, or miniature lion-head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
with bristling whiskers indicated and
large white-balled eyes, was missing. The
door-panel, with its flight of storks, and
stiff but wonderfully realistic bed of
rushes from which the storks had risen,
was slid aside, and through the narrow
opening the little dancing-girl fluttered
softly in, like some gay-hued butterfly or
large-winged night-moth.</p>

<p>“It is Snowflake!” exclaimed Kotmasu,
and ere the dainty little figure bowed low
before us, I caught a fleeting glance of recognition
shot to him from beneath her
drooped eyelids.</p>

<p>What a droll doll she is! Childish,
with an assumption of innocence which
is as charming as it must be unreal. An
elegant, slender little figure, full of dainty
grace. Her face painted—till it looked
positively funny—its whiteness hiding the
native transparency of her warm-hued
skin, all damask rose and nut-brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
tinted. And the two little dabs of rouge—oh!
with what inartistic exactness they
are placed, one on either cheek. The
little rosebud of a mouth, with childishly
pouting lips, is reddened brilliantly. And
the delicate nostrils of her charming little
nose—so piquant, so <i lang="fr">retroussé</i>—are
coloured just the same. Her jetty hair—somewhat
coarse, I admit, but so glossy—is
taken back from off her whitened brow,
and lies in smooth, heavy coils on the
shapely little head. A silver pin or two,
and one of mother-of-pearl, with some
charming baby-curls in rebellion on the
nape of her slender neck, soften any
severity.</p>

<p>And her dress. Plum-coloured brocade,
with long pendent sleeves and a double
tunic, the under one of a different stuff
and very light, opening to disclose garments,
such as her Western sisters are
struggling for, of canary-coloured satin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
vanishing into the curious <i lang="ja">tabi</i> of white
cotton, shoes and stockings all in one, with
separated toes.</p>

<p>She was such a fairy-like little being,
and her fan-play and posturing, which
passes for dancing, so charming and graceful,
that I could have watched her, as I
have other <i lang="ja">geishas</i>—soothed by the slumbrous
pad, pad of her gliding steps upon
the matting which covers the floor—almost
all night. But at last she gracefully
bowed, asked for her <i lang="ja">yen</i>, and withdrew
with the elegant fluttering motions of her
class.</p>

<p>With the exit of Snowflake one became
aware of the existence of time. Even
Kotmasu was becoming drowsy. I could
see through the open panels that the lanterns
in the garden outside were going out
one by one, beginning to give it a deserted
look. The moon was on the wane, the
white-faced moon in an indigo sky, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
walk home was a rather long one to which
to look forward.</p>

<p>We rose, my companion very reluctant
to go. The noise of the <i lang="ja">samisen</i> still continued
in the room beneath us, and the pad,
pad of the dancers had begun again to the
accompanying falsetto of the musicians’
voices, in a strange monotonous chant.</p>

<p>We had paid the bill, mysterious items
done in red ink upon a narrow strip of
satin-like rice-paper; and so we went out
by way of the verandah down the funny
little steps which led from it to the garden
path a dozen feet or less below.</p>

<p>We went down into the “garden of a
thousand lights,” and I idly counted those
whose hearts were cold, whilst Kotmasu
spoke to a friend.</p>

<p>“We are here!” said the friend, and in a
little pagoda near a willow I caught a
glimpse of others, a gay blot of colour in the
half-shadow denoting the presence of ladies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>And thus was it that I found Mousmé
and fell in love with her at first sight.</p>

<p>She, it appears, is the sister of Kotmasu’s
friend. In the subdued light of
the little pagoda, where all the lanterns
swinging to and fro in slight draught of
air are yellow or red, I am introduced with
marvellous ceremony to this radiant, childish
being who is destined at once to captivate
the heart and senses of the “English
sir,” as Kotmasu grandiloquently describes
me.</p>

<p>She is clad in silks of extreme richness,
and brocades which glitter with gold
thread (for her family is a wealthy one),
and her <i lang="ja">obi</i> of turquoise-blue silk swathes
her supple waist, and makes her look still
more slender by reason of its exaggerated
bow.</p>

<p>Her <i lang="fr">coiffure</i> is pyramidical, the ebon-hued
hair dressed <i lang="fr">à la</i> butterfly. And
the fantasy suits her; even the long, large-headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
pins, which serve as mock antennæ,
seem appropriate to the queer grace of my
mousmé. Her brilliant complexion is
softened by the subdued light. Only her
eyes sparkle innocently with interest.</p>

<p>Why had not Kotmasu presented me
before? Was he about to relinquish his
bachelor and somewhat erratic and amorous
habits? The thought gave me quite
a new sensation. Upon analysis I was
forced to admit that it was jealousy. Miss
Hyacinth (for that was Mousmé’s name, I
soon discovered), so fresh and delicate, a
little figure off a tea-caddy, quaint and
charming withal, had no doubt ensnared
his vagrant affections, as she had my own
admiration already.</p>

<p>Miss Hyacinth was addressing me in
soft tones from behind her paper fan,
which had pagodas, willows, and dainty
little women like herself painted upon it.</p>

<p>Yes! I had been in Nagasaki a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
time. I was English. No: England was
not like Japan. Everything was larger,
people ate more. There were no gardens
like these, except sometimes when there
was some grand feast taking place. This
is but a tithe of the replies I made.</p>

<p>“Are the women pretty, and do they
all wear rich clothing?” my mousmé inquired.</p>

<p>And I said “Some” in answer to the
former, and earned a petulant <i lang="fr">moue</i>. And
“Not often” in reply to the latter, gaining
thereby a smile of evident satisfaction as
my reward; adding that “an ugly climate
enforces ugly clothes.” But I felt sorry
almost on the instant, because she seemed
not to understand.</p>

<p>“No paper lanterns at night! Is
there then a moon?” with a look of wondering
astonishment and apprehension.</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>She seemed relieved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have been to school,” she explained,
with a delicate assumption of dignity. “I
have seen the map”—the Japanese maps
are marvellous things, some of them—“I
know where the mail-boats go. But there
are so many countries in the way. How
do they get there?”</p>

<p>All this in Japanese, of course, whilst
Kotmasu talked to her brother in an undertone
of the latest addition to the ranks of
the Nagasaki <i lang="ja">geishas</i>, a girl trained in
Yeddo. And the other ladies sipped their
tea and talked to the other men, who were
nonentities to me.</p>

<p>Kotmasu had finished his jokes about
the <i lang="ja">geishas</i>, and became, perhaps, aware of
my monopoly of Miss Hyacinth—whose
name indicated a far less <i lang="fr">voyant</i> flower
than Western minds would associate with
it—so he said, somewhat abruptly, “We
must go.”</p>

<p>For a moment Mousmé’s small, shapely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
hand, with its cool, white fingers, rested in
mine.</p>

<p>“I shake the hand English way,” she
explained, with a ripple of laughter. And
then, with low bows to the other ladies,
Kotmasu and I leave the merry party in
the pagoda, and go away down the steep
path bordered with the staring sunflowers.</p>

<p>I had read a few days before—and
laughed at the idea—a line in a verse of a
<em>decadent</em> poet that,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent11">“Woman gone,</div>
<div class="verse">The darkness wraps us round in sable pall.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But now I did not laugh; I felt it, and
understood.</p>

<p>I could have sworn that all the lanterns
were extinguished, that the stars had gone
down. And why? Because Kotmasu
and I had turned our backs upon a pair of
sparkling eyes, and I had put a hundred
feet or so between me and Miss Hyacinth’s
beguiling, coquettish personality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>We don’t talk much, and I switch
absent-mindedly at the flowers with my
toy cane of bamboo, as we pass along the
narrow path towards the spectral gateway,
now just visible at the bottom, a gaunt,
white skeleton. Not till I send a big sunflower’s
head spinning off and up against
my companion’s legs, who starts as if
something had bitten him, do I become
aware that we have not spoken since we
started down the hill.</p>

<p>Kotmasu pulls out his watch, a relic of
his college days in England, and I waste
a whole wax vesta—a luxury almost priceless
in Japan, which I cling to—in enabling
him to see the time.</p>

<p>Then we hurry out through the ghostly
gateway on to the rough road, and thence
onward down towards my house at as
quick a rate as the obstruction of loose
stones, sticks and ruts will let us.</p>

<p>Kotmasu shakes hands at my gateway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
No, he wouldn’t come in and have anything.
Whisky <i lang="ja">saké</i> would not tempt
him, and “brantwein” was too much for
his head, with still a good way down-hill
yet to go.</p>

<p>My house had never seemed so lonely.</p>

<p>I fancied, strange though it may appear,
that something—which after all had never
existed—was missing. The tiny rooms
seemed vast, the matting floor almost unfamiliar
in its deadly silence.</p>

<p>The servants are at rest, of course. I
think all I have to do is to push aside a
panel and enter. There are no locks; and
if there were, they would be but toy ones,
ingenious, but useless all the same. I
have a cash-box, a European one of tin,
but I have given it a rice-paper jacket,
because it looked so terribly substantial
amid all my other frail belongings.</p>

<p>How lonely it is! Even Oka the cook’s
snoring down in the basement does not
prove so companionable as usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>As I cross the floor of my bedroom, and
light the absurd little lamp near my apology
for a couch, the dry boards of the thin
flooring creak noisily and drearily beneath
my tread. Some of the youthful fear of
darkness is revived within me by the awful
silence and the fitful flicker of my lamp.
The little red-and-blue tortoises painted
on the paper panels near the window seem
to be coming to life and crawling about.</p>

<p>A glance out of the window as I throw
off the last of my garments does not reassure
me. Quite the reverse. It is so
black outside. So I close the casement,
and turn in sadly.</p>

<p>I lie thinking for some time in the dark,
and almost insensibly my thoughts revert
to our supper at the <i lang="ja">chaya</i> of “A Thousand
Lights” and to Kotmasu’s friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>A bright idea presents itself, solving
my longing and loneliness.</p>

<p>It is Miss Hyacinth I want, and such a
thing should not be impossible—in Japan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p>Next morning when I look out of my
window, whilst shaving in front of a
“trade” glass I had obtained after some
trouble for the express purpose, the view
charms me with its vastness, just as the
night before it had depressed me with its
indefinable starlight gloom. “The view,”
I say to myself, “is the only big thing
about Nagasaki.”</p>

<p>Down below lay the harbour, bathed in
Japanese sunlight, which—as even Japanese
advertisements are beginning to put it—is
like none other. On this particular
morning it was filtering through a silver
haze, and the water of the harbour looked
like a solid block of chrysoprase with indigo
shadows. In the distance one saw
flaws in it where a <i lang="ja">sampan</i> was, and white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
flecks where an incoming or outgoing foreign
trader sailed.</p>

<p>What a network of narrow streets there
was down below in the town proper!
Narrow streets—most of which by now I
knew—with slabs of stone laid in the
middle of them, and in the older quarters,
rickety houses nearly meeting overhead.
It was down there that Kotmasu had his
office, to which, however, owing to the industry
and keenness of his merchant father
before him, he was not very much tied. I
had made up my mind to go and see him
this morning, as he was usually to be found
there in the forenoon.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to look upon the green
hills, and even to watch the higher ones,
bare and brown-topped, break through the
fleecy mist hanging about their summits,
as I have my breakfast on the verandah
in the tiny cups and tinier plates and dishes
in which my servants delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“Surely Mousmé—Miss Hyacinth” (I
have got to call her this soon, in all
conscience)—“will like my house,” I
speculate as I swallow beans in sugar,
prunes in ditto, toy-sized cups of tea, and
Huntly and Palmer’s biscuits as my solid
dish. She lives down there somewhere,
nearer the town. I suddenly recollect
Kotmasu once pointing out her brother
Otiri to me, and telling me he lived somewhere
over there. This must be better up
here, and I remember quite gleefully that
M’Kenzie, my chum, who died last New
Year’s Day, had found no difficulty in
persuading a dainty little mousmé of
equally good family to take him for better,
for worse. I also recollect the circumstance
of his having reddish hair, and an
uncommon amount of freckles, even for a
Scotsman, with amazing satisfaction. Because,
although fair, I had neither of these
things, and had even some pretensions to
good looks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>I would go down and consult Kotmasu—that
was the best thing to do.</p>

<p>I gulped down two or three tiny cups of
tea, and hastily sought my hat.</p>

<p>Oka’s wife was under the verandah,
reeling silk off the cocoons on to strangely
primitive wooden wheels, fixed between
two upright pieces of wood stuck into a
flat stone or cake of hardened, sun-baked
clay for firmness. She rose, however, with
a smile, and bowing, gave me one of my
gayest paper umbrellas, “to match the
morning.” Strangely enough, the ground-work
was of the colour of Mousmé’s dress
the night before. I used not to admire it
greatly; now I wondered vaguely why.</p>

<p>I made my way down the hillside, striking
the principal street or road after I left
my own garden, in which camellias, gardenias,
tea-roses and mimosa bloomed with
such profusion, that the very air was scented
and heavy with the mingled perfume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a pretty garden—strange to
European eyes, perhaps—with its make-believe
fountains, toy bridges over equally
miniature streams, and several tiny pagodas.
It was pretty enough even for Miss
Hyacinth, I thought, as I thrust open the
quaint little rustic gate with my toe, and
stepped out upon the road.</p>

<p>All the way down to Kotmasu’s office I
imagined, or tried to imagine, her flitting
along the walks between the tea-roses and
sunflowers. A dainty little figure in an
elfin fairyland.</p>

<p>I had been down this way into the town
scores of times before, of course, and the
people knew me. The old man in the corner
shop of the street, whose signboard
was a queer mixture of Japanese and English
of a sort, was painstakingly decorating
the same large blue Nankin vase with
sprays of chrysanthemums and the inevitable
storks, as he was a week ago. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
this morning I didn’t stop, as I usually
did, for a chat and to express my admiration
for his painstaking art, which though
almost totally lacking perspective, was yet
quaint and pretty.</p>

<p>“No! I am in a hurry”—this to him.</p>

<p>“Is the sir going back to England?”</p>

<p>“No!” scarcely stopping.</p>

<p>“That is well! Good, good! The Nankin
vases you, most illustrious sir, are so
condescending as to admire are still unsold.
Will you take them, honourable sir? They
are——” All this I hear him say in his
queer, cracked, high-pitched, monotonous
voice ere I turn the corner.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Kotmasu is in,” replied San,
my friend’s clerk, and I could see him.</p>

<p>Kotmasu’s office is a strange mixture of
East and West. It is on the second floor
of a warehouse, down on the Natoba near
the water-side. He, with memories of
English ways, has a writing-table made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
mahogany, with camphor-wood and ebony
inlaid work; but he still writes with a
fine brush, either in Indian ink or vermilion,
as the occasion requires, on dainty
slips of flimsy and, to my Western mind,
unbusiness-like rice paper.</p>

<p>How a London merchant would laugh
at the idea of grinding up one’s ink in a
tiny saucer as one required it! And yet
this is just what my good friend was doing
when I entered—in a tiny jade saucer inlaid
with threads of gold, with a minute
bronze frog, just ready for a dive, upon
the edge.</p>

<p>I sat down in a revolving chair, which
had once graced the saloon of an English
steamer lost along the coast, and opened
fire upon Kotmasu concerning Miss Hyacinth.</p>

<p>I felt so miserably sure, with the pessimism
of an ardent lover, that he must be
in love with my darling. But it proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that he had no intentions. So much was
evident to me after five minutes’ talk in
the cool room. He didn’t want to chatter
about her, but began instead to tell me
untellable things about the new <i lang="ja">geisha</i>.
He didn’t even seem to think Miss Hyacinth
pretty. How strange, I thought!
And then he went on again to sing the
praises of the <i lang="ja">geisha</i>, who was called Silver-Moon
Face. His taste was evidently
vitiated; he preferred art to nature, tricks
to charms, a whitened face with two hectic
spots of rouge, and the gold-lined lip, to
the damask skin and smiles of my mousmé.
But all this was very satisfactory to me,
nevertheless.</p>

<p>I must have kept returning to the subject
of Miss Hyacinth, for all at once he
makes a discovery, and says without preamble,
and as if certain in his own mind
that he has “hit the right nail on the
head”—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Her people are rich, but still they
<em>might</em> be induced to sell her.”</p>

<p>“Man alive,” I say, without remembering
that Kotmasu’s English does not extend
to a knowledge of such a phrase,
“what do you think I want?”</p>

<p>He is laconic, and smiles. “Hyacinth—the
mousmé.”</p>

<p>“Yes! but it is not for a temporary
marriage”—I dress the phrase almost instinctively—“I
want to marry her.
Marry her as a wife, before the consul, or
any one else, for that matter. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>Kotmasu’s face is a study of simulated
obtuseness.</p>

<p>At last, however, I make him understand,
show him that I am in earnest.</p>

<p>Then he argues the matter in the politest
Japanese, so as to magnify my “honourable
position and name” as much as
possible, and without detracting from that
of Miss Hyacinth, show me my error.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is no use. I may be mad. We
shall see, I tell him with an indwelling
confidence; and he nods his head and remarks
stolidly, “Yes, we shall see.”</p>

<p>I should be angry with Kotmasu if I
did not know that his opposition, like all
the disagreeables of childhood, was intended
“for my good.”</p>

<p>In the end he promises to introduce me
to my inamorata’s family, and let circumstances
rule the rest.</p>

<p>I go out into the sunlight, down the
creaking outside stairs, quite light-hearted,
and only haggle for ten minutes with Yen-kow
the jeweller for a prospective engagement
ring with a magnificent pink
pearl.</p>

<p>I am sure as I leave the shop with the
ring in my pocket that my weakness over
the bargaining has lowered me fifty per
cent. in the eyes of the stout little jeweller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>I go and buy some hyacinths, and then
transact some of my business.</p>

<p>Kotmasu is coming to take me to see
Mousmé at sundown.</p>

<p>I am at home again early in the afternoon,
and, with a view to my proposed
marriage, I begin to take stock of my surroundings.</p>

<p>I have lived long enough in Japan to
see nothing exceptional in a marriage
which will probably be concluded in a
space of time that would be considered extremely
short to a Western mind. The
worst of it is, I am returning to England
for good in less than nine months’ time, and
what will my people say to my choice?</p>

<p>I have neither mother nor father to reckon
with. But I have a sister Lou, who,
alas, is a dragon of propriety (and I am no
St. George), who will, I fear, never realise
that my wife is not an abstraction off a
paper screen or a lacquer tray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>But then, after all, she will be my wife,
and because she is pretty and “strange”—I
fancy that’s what Lou will call her—she
may succeed in a society which, like
the Athenians, is always running after
some new thing. The latest “craze” is to
my mind like a glass of sherbet. It creates
the greatest amount of stir for the
least space of time.</p>

<p>Not even thoughts of Lou, who is the
pink of propriety—why isn’t impropriety
dubbed pink?—can terrify me from my purpose,
because I am in love. I never felt so
unafraid of Lou, her tongue and her smile,
in all my life, even at the distance of many
thousand miles, and I conclude therefrom
that I must be terribly in earnest. As for
the others, I don’t care.</p>

<p>They have pleased themselves, have
married as they wished, and surely may be
reasonably expected to let me do the same,
I argue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>My house, which seemed complete
enough before, now appears only to require
Miss Hyacinth’s presence to make it all
it should be.</p>

<p>I am very critical, but I can scarcely
find anything to alter in my little home.
My rooms at Cambridge, ere every one
went in for Art—with a big A—talked
Art, dreamed Art, abused Art, and outraged
Art—were considered artistic, and
my chambers in St. James’ Street the
same. It is in me, and has cropped out in
many of the little details of my Japanese
home. Clever and appreciative workmen
and artificers have enabled me to see my
desires carried into effect.</p>

<p>I play at having tea—imagining the
while how the little white room, which is
rather bare for European taste perhaps, but
so clean, airy and spotless, will look with
Mousmé in it; and then I go out on the
verandah to wait till Kotmasu comes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>From my position I can overlook the
road which runs away up alongside my
boundary fence, higher and higher, till at
last it vanishes amid the greenery and the
tea-gardens. Down below, the older quarters
of the town lie huddled together like
a flock of sheep crushing each other in the
endeavour to avoid some danger, swarming
with people of the poorer class. It is
not quite so fine an evening as last night
was, and the hill-tops are hidden in the
woolly masses of threatening clouds. The
twilight is gloomy, and not orange-hued as
before, and darkness comes more quickly
upon its heels.</p>

<p>I light my treasured briar, and wait as
patiently as may be for my friend.</p>

<p>When first I came here, how all my
acquaintances used to laugh at the immense
bowl of my pipe, which would, I
should think, hold nearly ten times as
much light-hued tobacco as theirs!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! Here he is at last!” I exclaim,
discerning a dark mass approaching in the
gloom, up the little narrow path.</p>

<p>“We will go at once?” I say questioningly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replies. “They will be at
home now.”</p>

<p>We start off down the hillside, Kotmasu
evidently from his remarks regarding
the matter as a huge joke. If only he
realized how sincere is my admiration for
Miss Hyacinth. At last we reach our
destination, and turn down a short road,
which shuts the gaily-lit town still further
below us from our view.</p>

<p>Miss Hyacinth is more charming than
ever. Or is it the coming in from the
gloom of the dark road, along which we
have picked our way by the light of paper
lanterns? She is quite delightful. She
even knows a little English, which she
learned at the school, so she tells me; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
we talk together, I smiling inwardly at
her funny phrasing.</p>

<p>“You speakee Japanese good,” she says,
with a glance from her sparkling eyes, and
red lips wide open in her struggle with the
last word.</p>

<p>I, of course, compliment her equally
upon her English, which I assert is “wonderful,”
“charming.”</p>

<p>This is all very interesting, and I more
decidedly—most decidedly—wish to marry
her.</p>

<p>I do not altogether like my mamma-in-law.
But no doubt matters can be so
arranged that my domestic peace will not
be too frequently broken in upon, nor my
artistic sense too often shocked by her
puffy cheeks, inane smile and gimlet-hole
eyes. To see her salute me—to witness
the elevation of the immense bow of her
dove-coloured silk <i lang="ja">obi</i> as she bent to the
floor—was too comical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Mousmé gets nothing from her mother, I
am glad to notice, except, perhaps, a certain
almost indefinable womanliness, which
all Japanese women seem to possess. It
is almost as intangible as some of their perfumes.</p>

<p>I am offered tea in dainty doll’s-house
cups of blue egg-shell china, and smoke a
ridiculous little pipe, because Miss Hyacinth
prepared it for me, stuffing the tobacco
into the tiny bowl with the tip of
her small finger. She smoked, too, a little
silver-mounted pipe, with a great deal of
useless ornamentation on it; but refused
my offer of a service like that rendered to
me. She let me light it, however, with a
bit of glowing charcoal, held in a pair of
tongs which were formed by bronze lizards
placed in the necessary acrobatic pose; and
seemed pleased with the attention I paid
her.</p>

<p>Mousmé, for so I begin to call her, has,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
it appears, several brothers and sisters;
but I reflect placidly that if a man mustn’t
marry his grandmother, neither is he
obliged, so to speak, to marry his wife’s
relations. Her little brother, Aki, a scrap
of yellow humanity, with wonderful black
eyes, and equally dark hair, is the only
member of the family besides her mother
present. And he—not yet at the <i lang="fr">enfant
terrible</i> stage of existence—regards me
with curious but, I flatter myself, not unfriendly
gaze, between bouts of playing
with several minute bronze frogs and a
box of dominoes.</p>

<p>Kotmasu keeps up an uninterrupted
conversation in a rather grating undertone,
whilst Miss Hyacinth and I chatter, and
gradually get upon most friendly terms.</p>

<p>I am quite sure that she already thinks
I wish to marry her. And possibly the
only question now agitating her mind is,
“For how long?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Permanent marriages between Europeans
and Japanese women are as infrequent
as temporary ones are the reverse.</p>

<p>I am more than ever in love with
Mousmé by the time of our departure, and
am beginning to feel pained that I cannot
relieve her mind as to my intentions being
permanent. To do so will be quite possible
without any breach of decorum in two
or three days.</p>

<p>Kotmasu is full of the marriage, and as
we walk homeward he tells me that
Mousmé’s mother will be delighted. He
has at least commenced to arrange things,
I think, with the celerity of a professed
matrimonial broker.</p>

<p>“But,” he said, “she is nevertheless
surprised that you should not require Miss
Hyacinth on trial.”</p>

<p>“Did you say anything to her, then?”
I ask in my surprise.</p>

<p>“It is all arranged, if you are willing,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
he answered, with some amount of pride
at his successful diplomacy.</p>

<p>“But what about Miss Hyacinth herself?”</p>

<p>“She! Oh, she will be only too honoured
to wed with the English sir.”</p>

<p>How strange Mousmé’s easy compliance
with my wishes appears to me. But I accept
Kotmasu’s statement gratefully, for
at least it relieves my anxiety.</p>

<p>I laugh quite light-heartedly; it is all
so delightfully easy. And when I have
had a smoke, after Kotmasu has drunk
my health comically thrice over in whiskey
<i lang="ja">saké</i> and departed, I turn in and fall asleep,
thinking that he is really a very good
fellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p>All has gone well, and I am to be married
to-morrow. Kotmasu is to be best
man, and for this purpose he has hunted
out from the depths of his disused steamer-trunk
an antiquated suit of Bond Street
“morning attire,” a relic of his stay in
London; which, if less modern, is more
correct than the creations of Kinew, the
Anglo-Japanese tailor near the quay, who
has a tendency, so I am told, to make his
coats short in the waist.</p>

<p>Mousmé’s mother is delighted—a state
of mind perhaps not altogether unconnected
with various handsome presents which
faithful Kotmasu, who should be a member
of the <i lang="fr">corps diplomatique</i>, naïvely
suggested my making her.</p>

<p>The marriage can be very easily contracted;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and Kotmasu, who still seems to
have little or no faith in my constancy, has
assured me, over and over again, that if,
after all, I should change my mind about
taking Mousmé with me back to England,
a few more handsome presents to Mousmé’s
mother, and the gift of a couple of
hundred <i lang="ja">yen</i>, with a handsome dress or
two, to Mousmé herself, will simplify
matters.</p>

<p>But I am vain enough to think that this
is not so; and that the gleams of Western
ideas which I have detected in Mousmé’s
conversations, picked up doubtless at the
school, may cause liking to ripen into a
lasting affection on her side, and be the
forerunners of greater breadth of mind.
There is a great deal of complexity about
relationship in Japan, and I had long ago
ceased to be surprised at anything in this
way; but I received a mild shock on my
wedding day when I discovered to what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
innumerable families—to say nothing of
individuals—I had allied myself. In fact,
I somewhat ruefully thought that I must
be brother-in-law, son-in-law or grandson-in-law
to half the Japanese population of
Nagasaki.</p>

<p>The marriage company was a study—if
I had been in the humour to make one—of
all sorts and conditions of men, women,
children and babies, all gathered together
to do honour to the marriage of their kinswoman,
Miss Hyacinth, with “the most
honourable English sir.”</p>

<p>Mousmé’s mother was resplendent in one
of my “handsome presents,” and her compliments
were interminable. She advanced
smilingly to meet me, and remained
in the same condition throughout the
whole proceedings. I felt almost as nervous
as I should have been expected to be
had I contracted an aristocratic alliance in
England, culminating in a smart wedding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
I have very little recollection of the details
of a day, or rather part of a day, which
seemed to resolve itself into a series of oft-repeated
salutations and endless congratulations,
refreshments, smoke and discreetly
repressed excitement.</p>

<p>At length it was over.</p>

<p>I had plucked my Hyacinth, and was
free to lead her away to my home.</p>

<p>Mousmé in all her bridal finery of flowered
satin gown, and <i lang="ja">obi</i> of plum-coloured
silk; Mousmé with the shy face, and
pretty ways which might or might not be
artificial.</p>

<p>I was to discover all this, perhaps, and
many other things.</p>

<p>The legal formalities had been all previously
arranged with the assistance of my
excellent Kotmasu, who is a person of
some importance, and of weight with the
officials who attend to such matters.</p>

<p>There is really such a very little to do;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
so few things for Mousmé to transport to
her new home; nearly all could be easily
packed in a large Gladstone if she possessed
such a thing. As it is, her belongings
are brought up the hill to my house
in an elaborately decorated lacquer box, by
a big little brother with a bullet-head, nice
eyes, and a great liking for <i lang="ja">teriyaki</i> (plums
in sugar coats). This box is a fit ornament
for the boudoir of a princess, I think, as
the youngster puts it down in a corner
with a sigh, produced by aching arms.</p>

<p>I smile and fancy how Lou would laugh
at a trousseau contained in a lacquer box
measuring about 20 inches by 12 inches by
10 inches!—remembering that hers, which
was described at portentous length and
with unblushing detail in the columns of
the <cite>Queen</cite> and <cite>Lady’s Pictorial</cite>, must have
occupied little short of six large Saratoga
trunks. But what matter? This style of
thing is a mere flaunting of wealth by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Dives before the aching eyes of Lazarus.
Even the wealthiest can only wear one
dress at a time, and Mousmé can do this,
and with far more grace than some of the
salt of society.</p>

<p>As for Mousmé, she seems quite at
home. She soon unpacks her tiny box;
and, noticing that things connected with
my toilet, such as my razors, hair-brushes,
comb, and tin of shaving soap, are arranged
near the window on an improvised
dressing-table which was (when I first
took the house) in reality an idol stand,
she arranges hers there too. How queer
they look, to be sure!</p>

<p>Alongside my shaving soap now stands
a tiny lacquer pot with a jade lid, on
which is carved a wonderfully pretty group
of storks, containing the rouge which gives
a delicate sunset flush to her cheeks. She
puts a little on at once, right in front of
me, as naturally as another woman might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
wash her hands, probably because she feels
she must do something before a glass
which is, as she puts it, “so big and great
and bright,” compared to those to which
she has been accustomed. Then there is a
little pot—also with a jade lid—containing
a white face preparation, the use of which
I shall at once inhibit; this she puts close
beside the other by the force of association
of ideas. The tiny brushes, with backs of
tortoise-shell, the combs of the same, the
hairpins with big eccentric knobs, are all
placed near my gigantic brushes.</p>

<p>Then her few garments are taken from
the box and hung—also like mine—on
pegs which I have had put up on the wall
near my mattress-like bed.</p>

<p>Mousmé is satisfied with her work, exclaiming,
“Velly good ting that!” in the
monotonous voice of a person speaking an
unaccustomed tongue, and we are ready
for our first meal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>She is pleased with herself, with me,
with her new home, with everything.
And after our dinner, during which she has
chattered in most diverting English, learned
at school from an “English teacher,” anxious
to please me, whom she still, I fear,
looks upon as her owner, she proposes to
sing.</p>

<p>What queer English it was!—often almost
unrecognizable from mispronunciation.
She still calls me “Mister,” and almost
makes me choke with smothered
laughter each time.</p>

<p>Fully twenty minutes are occupied in
attempts to master the appalling intricacies
of “Cyril”—my name. The nearest approach
as yet is “Cy-reel,” which must do
for the present, with lapses into “Mister”
when she forgets.</p>

<p>Whilst I smoke, Mousmé sings songs in
a soft little tone, to the accompaniment of
her long-necked <i lang="ja">samisen</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>She has a rather pretty voice, and more
idea of expression than any other Japanese
singer I have heard.</p>

<p>Night comes at last, and after a long
look down from the verandah at the hundreds
of lights gleaming far below, we go
to rest upon the mattresses which Oka’s
wife has unrolled ready for us upon the
floor; Mousmé with her head fixed into
the groove of a block of mahogany, which
serves her as a pillow, and preserves her
wonderful erection of hair intact.</p>

<p>We are under a huge mosquito-net, of
course—one of steel-blue gauze. When I
first came I used to detest the confinement,
and tried to do without it. But mosquitos
are invincible, humanity frail, and the
epidermis easily punctured. I returned to
the protection of what I laughingly got to
call “my meat-safe,” after the second
night.</p>

<p>Outside our tent-like mosquito-curtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
we hear the angry buzzing of the foe;
whilst big, heavy-winged moths every now
and again come with a tiny thud against
the enshrouding gauze, to dart away again
towards the small, glowworm-like flame of
the pendent lamp, which for no particular
reason I always keep alight throughout
the night.</p>

<p>When I awake next morning with the
sunlight streaming in through one of the
shutters, which the warmth of the previous
night induced me to leave open, Mousmé
is sleeping still, sleeping as peacefully as a
child, her face wreathed in the smile of a
happy dream, and her head still resting
upon her little wooden pillow.</p>

<p>I creep out from beneath the environing
curtain without disturbing her, after carefully
reconnoitring lest one of the enemy
should gain entrance.</p>

<p>I blow out the tiny flame of the lamp,
which looks so horribly yellow and sickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in the daylight, put on my flannels, and go
out into the garden.</p>

<p>I am going to get some flowers for
Mousmé when she awakes. I cross one of
the tiny bridges—spanning an equally tiny
streamlet—which seem made only in children’s
size, and which creak complainingly
beneath my tread, and make my way to
the thicket of roses in which my soul delights.
A big frog contemplates me with
an offensively open stare for an instant,
from the edge of the basin of the plashing
fountain, before diving with outstretched
hind-legs beneath the shining surface. The
red-gold noses of the fish, which are poked
just above the water as they nibble at the
edges of the lily leaves, disappear instantly
the surface is ruffled.</p>

<p>I gather a huge bunch of damask-petalled
tea-roses, heavy with perfume, and
smelling as attar never smells. As I go
along the walk with the mossy edge, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
which lizards and strangely beautiful
beetles play hide-and-seek in the sun, in
search of some gardenias, the stanzas of a
native poet stray through my mind, commencing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The dew shines on the lily; and the rose opens her crimson heart to greet the rising sun.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I soon have my sprigs of gardenias mingled
with the roses, and I return to the
house, hoping to lay my offering by Mousmé’s
side ere she awakes.</p>

<p>I enter the strangely bare bedroom, with
its gray panels and vermilion storks, from
the verandah. A queer old idol, belonging
to the former owner of the house, grins—there
is no other word for an accurate description—benign
approval from its
pedestal in the corner. I had retained it
because it filled a niche; because I have
rather a <i lang="fr">penchant</i> for curios; and lastly,
because, as an irrepressible midshipman
nephew once put it, “It’s the jolliest-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
old idol I’ve ever seen—a combination
of J. L. Toole and Madame Blavatsky.”</p>

<p>Mousmé is still asleep when I enter, but
the creaky floor awakes her ere I have half
crossed it. She rubs her eyes in a somewhat
bewildered fashion, and then with a
smile promptly buries her little <i lang="fr">retroussé</i>
nose in the posy I have brought.</p>

<p>Then she rises from the mattress-like
bed, a blue linen gowned little figure with
tiny bare feet, and nails on them like rose
leaves, and trots across the matting floor to
a position in front of our improvised dressing-table.</p>

<p>She peers into the glass anxiously to see
whether her slumbers have disturbed her
hair, touches the thick, neatly-arranged
plaits with deft fingers on either side of
her smiling face, and then laughs at my
amusement.</p>

<p>Mousmé’s toilet is a very simple matter.
She has few garments to put on, no hair to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
do, or rather no hair which wants doing,
her elaborate <i lang="fr">coiffure</i> being a permanent
erection for some considerable time. She
tells me that it took “nearly a large day
to do it,” and I quite believe her; it is
such a wonderful erection.</p>

<p>All is so delightfully simple. She puts
on her little patches of rouge—with a less
reckless hand, in deference to my opinions
on the subject—in a trice, puffs some white
powder upon her cheeks and charmingly
impudent nose, reddens her lips with the
certitude of a practised hand, slips into her
gown of flowered silk, and with a pretty
little pleading <i lang="fr">moue</i> entreats me to tie the
enormous bow of her brilliantly coloured
<i lang="ja">obi</i>; and hey, presto! as the conjurer says,
almost in less time than it takes a Western
woman to put on her bonnet, Mousmé’s
toilet is complete, and she is ready for our
make-believe playing at breakfast.</p>

<p>She eats her sugared plums with dainty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
grace, and drinks an astonishing number of
cups of pale amber-coloured tea; but then
the cups are so small that her doing so
provokes little wonder in my mind. She
has, perhaps, a misgiving that she has
eaten more than I can afford, although I
overheard my mother-in-law telling her
that I was a very rich man; for she says,
interrogatively, “I eat too great velly
much? Not eat so again?”</p>

<p>I smilingly assure her that she is to eat
as much as she can, and she laughs and gets
up to attend to the flowers on the verandah,
and place fresh blossoms in the blue
china bowls which stand on eccentric
perches on the walls, in the corners of the
room, on a bamboo and lacquer cabinet,
and on my English-pattern knee-hole writing-table
in the window.</p>

<p>Mousmé has deft fingers and good taste,
and the flowers seem to arrange themselves
in negligently artistic masses beneath her
touch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>She makes an exquisite picture as she
flutters about in the bright sunshine of
this white, airy room, in her dress of rich,
gay colours.</p>

<p>I sit still, and desist from my mail letter
to watch her. And as I do so, I become
aware that a journalist who “did” Japan
may be forgiven much for one true, picturesque
phrase, “Japanese women are
butterflies—<em>with hearts</em>.”</p>

<p>The cicalas chirp unceasingly, making a
natural orchestral accompaniment to her
movements—the chirping cicalas, which
seem to rest neither day nor night.</p>

<p>The only bowl still unfilled with flowers
is that on the table at which I am sitting.
Perhaps she is still too shy of me to touch
it. A thought has evidently flitted
through her pretty head, for she goes out
on to the balcony, and a minute later I see
her slender, quaint little figure going
down one of the sunlit garden-walks, evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in search of something. A lizard
scuttles away across the path at her approach,
to cower amongst the moss and
tea-roses; and as she turns the corner
towards the gold-fish pond, I catch a last
glimpse of the huge, brilliant bow of her
<i lang="ja">obi</i> which I laboriously tied an hour or so
before.</p>

<p>It is very pleasant to have my pretty
little mousmé flitting about my home and
garden. I wonder somewhat vaguely why
her absence has never struck me before.
Love apparently is one of those flavours of
life which one misses least when one has
not enjoyed its piquancy.</p>

<p>I take up the thread of my letter to Lou
again. It is a thousand pities, I think as
I do so, that I cannot present Mousmé to
her some such bright morning as this, and
in Japan. The rarest gem is best seen in
its proper setting. How surprised Lou
will be! She is large and fresh-coloured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
There is sure to be an explosion. How
well I know the sort of thing which is certain
to occur! Her handsome face will
redden, and the letter will be tossed across
to Bob with a sharp, “How ridiculous of
him! He really should think of us a little.
I only hope he won’t bring the
woman here. Fancy a Japanese sister-in-law!
Why, Bob, you’re laughing! It’s
no laughing matter, I can assure you. A
yellow-faced, painted scrap of a woman.
There——” I can hear her in imagination
saying all this, and in my mind’s eye see
her expression. Ah! Lou, I also remember
that all your roses are not of Dame
Nature’s giving, and that others—malicious,
no doubt—have remarked upon the
fact.</p>

<p>I hear the patter of feet coming up the
verandah steps. It is Mousmé returning.
Ah! Mousmé, you and I will conquer
London together! You with your dainty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
grace and <i lang="fr">piquante</i> face, I with my
wealth, as you esteem it, and family name.</p>

<p>Her hands are so full of flowers that
she has to push aside the panel with one
knee ere she can enter.</p>

<p>She comes across to my table and
places the blossoms in the empty bowl of
bronze.</p>

<p>By a stroke of genius in coquetry the
flowers are hyacinths!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>When she has finished their arrangement,
she says smilingly, her lips parted,
and twin rows of white pearls showing
between them:</p>

<p>“They are me. You never forget me
when you see them!”</p>

<p>“No! Mousmé, I never shall.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p>I have only seen Kotmasu once since our
marriage, now five days ago; and then it
was quite by accident, down near the quay,
where I had gone to discover whether my
quarterly parcel of magazines and books
had arrived, which Lou with commendable
regularity despatches “to that brother of
mine who is out in Japan, living at one of
those towns with a heathenish and unpronounceable
name.”</p>

<p>Kotmasu seemed somewhat surprised to
see me.</p>

<p>“Where is Madame?” he asks with a
smile, as though—as no doubt he did—he
half suspected she had returned to her
mother already.</p>

<p>I must have shown that I read the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
undercurrent of suggestion somewhat plainly.
“At home,” I answered. “You wouldn’t
surely expect me to bring her out at this
part of the day, in all this heat, and down
here, too!”</p>

<p>“No! no! Of course not,” he hastened
to reply.</p>

<p>I was somewhat mollified by his evident
anxiety to put matters straight again
between us. He can scarcely, I thought,
be expected to have the same faith in my
experiment as I have. To him my marriage,
until it has existed for some time, can,
I realize, only appear in the light of a temporary
arrangement.</p>

<p>“Why do you not come up as you
used?” I inquire in a friendly tone.</p>

<p>“It is your—what you call it?—something
to do with the bees and the moon.
I did not care to intrude,” he replies
deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“How ridiculous! We shall be always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
glad to see you, my good fellow,” I reply,
laughing as naturally as I can.</p>

<p>Kotmasu is so terribly English.</p>

<p>Even his attire this morning is that odd
mixture of Anglo-Japanese garments he so
much affects, consisting of a straw hat and
tennis flannels, worn in conjunction with
the flowered dressing-gown-like garment of
a well-to-do merchant.</p>

<p>He looks a strange figure as he stands
talking to me, in the sun, at the corner of
the little narrow alley leading from the
water-side into one of the newer streets,
the incongruities of his garments thrown
up into strong relief by a background
formed by the sail of a large trading-junk
alongside the quay, which a swarm of Japanese
coolies, all dressed alike in tight hose
and dark butcher’s-blue cotton tunics, with
some <i lang="fr">bizarre</i> device in a different colour
on the back, were unloading with extraordinary
rapidity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“I must go back to the warehouse,” he
says, after considering my remark. “I
will come to see you to-night.”</p>

<p>He shakes hands; and a coolie who has
been staring at my “strange white face,”
as I overheard him call it, for at least five
minutes, to the neglect of his work, appears
much mystified by the supposed rite.</p>

<p>I am glad Kotmasu is coming, as I wish
him to believe in my experiment as thoroughly
as I do myself.</p>

<p>The books have come, and I return to
the warehouse of my parcels-agent to see
if they are unpacked.</p>

<p>Mr. Karu’s office is always a source of
wonder to me.</p>

<p>The amount of business transacted there,
in a building of toy-like dimensions and
fragile structure, was little less than marvellous.
Whenever a parcel heavier than
usual was dropped on the floor by a careless
coolie, I expected that the room, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
its ink-stained, paper-panelled walls, on
which were pasted or fixed with quaint-headed
pins the steamship bills and those
of several of the theatre tea-houses, would
collapse forthwith with no more warning
than the crack of its slight, dry timbers.</p>

<p>The parcel was ready.</p>

<p>Mr. Karu was all smiles. He was a
little, short man with extremely beady
eyes, quick movements, and a yellow skin
deeply pitted by small-pox.</p>

<p>“It is very big to-day!” he exclaimed
in Japanese, referring to the package.
“Very much larger; half a <i lang="ja">yen</i> more,
please, most honourable gentleman,” as I
put down the usual amount.</p>

<p>The smiles were explained; and there
was no doubt some truth, I thought, in
what the little chief-clerk at the bank,
who is so anxiously cultivating a beard,
said, namely, “That most excellent friend,
Karu, is in great much hurry to get much
rich man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>I pay what I know to be in great part
an imposition, with an indulgent grin—I
am in a hurry to get back to Mousmé, or
might have argued the matter even in this
heat—accept the offer of a coolie to carry
my parcel for the equivalent of three-halfpence,
and start to climb up the shady
side of the rough-paved street to my home.</p>

<p>Mousmé was waiting for me at the little
gate in the toy fence of bamboo—a fence
the like of which in no country save Japan
would have been deemed sufficient for the
purpose intended.</p>

<p>She came forward to be kissed (I had
had to give her a few lessons in this custom)
with her chin—which in the sunlight
was as if carved out of ivory, so fine is the
texture of her skin—tilted up, and the
red rosebud mouth wreathed in a smile.
Mousmé is learning European ways rapidly.
My experiment seems very promising; and
she is evidently growing very fond of me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
She is learning English, and even the
English alphabet, so books are becoming
of interest to her, especially those with
pictures in them.</p>

<p>“What is there?” she inquires eagerly
in Japanese, pointing to the parcel which
the coolie carries on ahead of us up the
garden-walk.</p>

<p>“Books.”</p>

<p>“Books? More books!”</p>

<p>My slender library, contained on shelves
about five feet high and three feet six
broad, appears illimitable to her.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, smiling.</p>

<p>“Are there pictures in them?”</p>

<p>“I expect so.”</p>

<p>“Hi!” to the coolie staggering under
the weight of the parcel. “<i lang="ja">Hayaku!</i>
Walk faster! Run!”</p>

<p>And then, almost before I know she has
left my side, she is gone, hurrying with
short steps up the moss-bordered walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
after the coolie, who has quickened his
pace into a shambling run.</p>

<p>By the time I reach the house at my
slower rate, and enter my room by way
of the balcony, she has already got the
parcel in front of her on a square of white
matting in a patch of brilliant sunshine.</p>

<p>The only fault I am able to find with
Mousmé’s face is that it is somewhat apathetic
at times, a trifle expressionless. It
is animated enough now, however. A
look of eager curiosity suffuses it. She is
like some gay-coloured humming-bird in
her brilliant-hued dress, squatting there in
the patch of sunlight, already at work
with nimble, painstaking fingers upon the
knots of the string around the parcel,
coaxing loose the more stubborn ones with
the point of one of her immense jade-topped
hairpins.</p>

<p>Lou has sent some magazines this quarter
which delight Mousmé immensely—<cite>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Strand</cite>, <cite>English Illustrated</cite>, and a copy of
the <cite>Universal Review</cite>. This last is a veritable
El Dorado of pictures, and provokes
exclamations of delight when Mousmé turns
the pages over. Only there is so much she
cannot understand.</p>

<p>One particular picture in a number of
the <cite>English Illustrated</cite>, a group of ladies
at an evening party, mystifies her immensely.</p>

<p>“Why are all these women cut out in
the middle?” she asks with a puzzled expression.
“Are they all born like that?”</p>

<p>“No,” I reply.</p>

<p>“Then do they make themselves like
that?” glancing at her own slender
though by no means exaggerated figure.</p>

<p>“Yes; they make themselves so, I suppose.
It is a custom of our nation, and
other European nations,” I explain as
best I can.</p>

<p>“Oh!” with another look at the ultra-fashionably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
slender figure of the woman in
the foreground of the picture. “How
very uncomfortable!”</p>

<p>We both laugh; I because Mousmé
makes this last remark in such a finite
voice, and without any real idea of its
naïve truthfulness, and she because to her
loose-robed little body such a fashion appears
highly ridiculous.</p>

<p>There is evidently something mysterious
about this funny custom, which, as Mousmé
says, “makes women look as if a dog had
bitten a great piece out of them, both
sides;” for she says, ere turning over the
page:</p>

<p>“Shall I do that when I go with you
to England?”</p>

<p>“No, certainly not.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because you’re much prettier as you
are.”</p>

<p>Mousmé smiles contentedly, and pats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
my big hand, which looks so very large
beside hers, and rambles off to tell me of a
lizard she found in our bed just before I
came back from the town; whilst I, glancing
over the pages of one of the magazines,
divide my attention between her story and
a critique of <cite>Robert Elsmere</cite>.</p>

<p>The time passes very quickly with
Mousmé; she is soon tired of looking at
books and papers which, at present, she
only half understands; and lest she should
interrupt me, she gets up, and goes with a
hushed pad, pad of her shoeless feet into
our bedroom, to fetch a strange little lacquer
box which contains her writing materials.
A flat shell, with lovely mother-of-pearl
tints on its nacre hollow, in which
she grinds her Indian ink; the fine paintbrush,
which plays the part of pen; the
flimsy rice-paper, in long, thin strips, and
envelopes to match, are among her belongings,
and are decorated with tiny pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of trees and strangely grotesque animals,
birds and fishes. She is going to write
to her mother, to ask her to send up a sash
of turquoise-blue silk which was left behind
when she was married, and which she
has found out I admired.</p>

<p>I watch her as she writes, her head bent
over her paper, and the lower half of her
face in shadow—such a scrap of daintily
dressed femininity.</p>

<p>I wonder what else she is saying—women’s
inter-confidences are always so
distressing and perplexing to a man—for
she has already covered one long strip
with delicately minute writing, which at
a little distance looks like the ground-plan
of an intricate maze; and surely even a
turquoise silk <i lang="ja">obi</i> cannot call for such a
lengthy description, except, perhaps, in
a Parisian fashion-journal.</p>

<p>She has finished by the time I have cut
the pages of one of the novels Lou has included<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
in the parcel; and, with a solemnity
worthy of the best traditions of the
Japanese official, she seals it up securely
in an envelope of whitey-blue rice-paper—so
small, that it necessitates the folding
of the letter half a dozen times.</p>

<p>One of the ever-amiable Oka’s almost
innumerable children, a quaint toddler of
five, with a queer, shaven head, with its
little ebon queue, and small, bright, black
beads of eyes, is easily persuaded to take
it down to Mousmé’s mother for a couple
of <i lang="ja">sen</i>.</p>

<p>Then we have tea.</p>

<p>Really it is a sort of dinner, a nondescript
meal best conveyed to the mind by
that equally nondescript English phrase,
“high tea”—a strange meal indulged in
by people who are too hungry to have
tea, and too modest to have a second
dinner.</p>

<p>How Mousmé can tackle plums still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
green, though coated in sugar, without
paying the penalty for her seeming indiscretion,
is a mystery. But she does;
and I sit and watch her in genuine though
unexpressed admiration. The shrimps,
really large prawns, with their intricately
stuffed interiors, I can venture upon; and
seaweed, with sweet sauce, I take with
resignation. She does not care for the
latter to-night, and so she goes to a panel
cupboard, where we keep our priceless
English biscuits cunningly hidden from
the possible depredations of Oka’s somewhat
inquisitive children, and eats some of
these instead, nibbling off first the pink-and-white
sugar decorations, which are
such a source of delight.</p>

<p>We have scarcely finished our meal, and
Mousmé is still nibbling a biscuit, when we
hear the sound of Kotmasu’s expected footsteps
coming up the garden-path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p>It is clear to me from Kotmasu’s talk,
glances, and conduct in general, that he
has not yet got to consider Mousmé in the
light of the mistress of the house. I am
also sure that he even yet cannot understand
that my marriage with her is anything
more serious than a passing freak, a
fancy of the hour.</p>

<p>He is very familiar with her, and she
with him—they have known each other so
long—chatting together quite freely. I
am not jealous, surely; but I suddenly discover
that it is time to go out. Kotmasu
at once agrees that it is, and Mousmé seems
delighted.</p>

<p>Where shall we go?</p>

<p>That is the all-important question, which
is not easily settled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Mousmé inclines to paying her mother a
visit; Kotmasu to visiting a little play-house
down below in Nagasaki, where
some new <i lang="ja">geishas</i> from Yeddo are to make
their <i lang="fr">début</i>.</p>

<p>I am not so fond of my mother-in-law as
I should be, nor of my perplexingly numerous
sisters and brothers-in-law, both small
and great. The former I suspect of rapacity,
an insatiable appetite for “handsome
presents,” which, if not always very costly
in European eyes, are certainly numerous,
and range from <i lang="fr">rouge fin</i> (imported from
Paris) and <i lang="fr">blanc perle</i> to gay-hued <i lang="ja">obis</i> and
handsome hairpins of tortoise-shell, or of
bronze with carved jade heads.</p>

<p>Fancy supplying one’s mother-in-law
with rouge! But it was Kotmasu’s doing.
He was evidently in her confidence; for he
said one day, just as my marriage arrangements
were nearing completion:</p>

<p>“You give Madame Choto some rouge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
The woman very fond of it. You make
her like you.”</p>

<p>This being what I wished her to do, I
did as friend Kotmasu desired, expending
three <i lang="ja">yen</i> (12s.) upon a box at Yan’s, the
best druggist in Nagasaki, and paying at
least four times its original price. The
only satisfaction I have is the knowledge
that my mother-in-law’s complexion is of
the best!</p>

<p>Mousmé clearly is to-night all for going
down to Madame Choto’s, but I have one
trump card to play against that. I am
destined to find it in the future—as in the
past—of great service. I have merely to
say, “Let us go and look at the shops.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” answers Mousmé with alacrity,
clapping her small hands.</p>

<p>And so it is settled.</p>

<p>The recollection of Madame Choto and
the little brothers and sisters she was half
a minute ago so bent on visiting, speedily
fades from her mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Kotmasu agrees readily enough, no
doubt thinking that there is still a chance
of our dropping in, later on, at the Willow
Tree Theatre, to see the famous <i lang="ja">geishas</i>
from Yeddo.</p>

<p>To get down into the town at night is a
matter of some difficulty, the path being
so rough and unlighted. Of course, we
carry lanterns—nearly every one does at
night—and one constantly meets processions
of families or friends, out either for a
walk or on their way to some place of
amusement, all carrying paper lanterns of
various colours, and giving a pretty, fantastic
effect to the dark roads and narrow
streets of the town.</p>

<p>It is far more interesting to go down
into the older quarter of the town, the true
Japanese, if so I may call it—the native
quarter unalloyed by European customs
and commerce.</p>

<p>Mousmé leaves us for an instant to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
out three paper lanterns with their slender,
quivering carrying-sticks of bamboo.
She at any rate is all eagerness to be off,
visions of possible purchases for her personal
adornment doubtless flitting through
her mind.</p>

<p>It is nicer out under the verandah; the
dry wood roof, in which the cicalas live a
chirping existence, seems to be giving out
the heat with which a thorough sun-baking
has stored it during the day.</p>

<p>Kotmasu and I step out on to the balcony
to await Mousmé’s coming with the
lanterns.</p>

<p>There is no moon to-night, and the
clouds hang low, making the evening dull
and close. Everything is so still, with a
deep silence that is at once oppressive and
slightly terrifying, until one is accustomed
to it. Down below lies the town, like
some vast black monster with many twinkling
eyes. There is no wind; indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
there is scarcely enough air to disperse the
smoke of our cigars, the ends of which
glow like the red eyes of some wild animal.
I can just see Kotmasu’s face when his
glows brighter as he inhales.</p>

<p>“And you are not getting bored?” he
asks, puffing a cloud of smoke amongst the
foliage of a creeper trailing at his elbow.</p>

<p>I know what he means, although he
mentions no name, because we are talking
in Japanese, and Mousmé may even now
be creeping silently, as is her wont, across
the room behind us.</p>

<p>“No; I am charmed. She is even more
charming than I thought. I shall certainly
go home to England as soon as I can.”</p>

<p>“And take her?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; why not?”</p>

<p>Kotmasu can on occasion be fairly concise,
if not epigrammatic.</p>

<p>“Mousmé in Bond Street!” he ejaculated;
and if he had been English, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
knew instinctively that he would have
whistled.</p>

<p>“Why Bond Street?” I asked somewhat
feebly, with just a shade of chilliness at
my heart from the incongruity conjured up
by his words.</p>

<p>“Because,” he replied slowly, “that
would be a good test.”</p>

<p>I might have attempted a reply, but there
is a sudden glow of light on the verandah,
a yellow-red, diffused light, which fails to
pierce the gloom at the far end, and
Mousmé and Oka appear with the lanterns.</p>

<p>Mousmé gives me a kiss, to the peril of
her lantern with its monster of a crayfish
painted in vermilion on its yellow side; at
which Kotmasu smiles indulgently; then
we start off.</p>

<p>We go away down our garden—which
has such narrow paths, some of them
scarcely less pigmy than those associated
in my memory with the garden of childhood’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
days—now so dark and full of
mysterious shadows, heavy with the strong
scent of flowers, alive with the incessant
noise of the cicalas, and movements of
huge, soft-winged night-moths, which circle
round the light of our lanterns, beating
their wings with a soft, quick rattle against
their distended sides, and every now and
again flying into our faces and making
Mousmé give a little scream of simulated
terror, at which Kotmasu and I laugh.</p>

<p>I shut the gate after us, and then taking
Mousmé’s arm, we make our way down the
rapidly sloping road. There is another
party ahead of us, also with lanterns; and
so steep is the path, that in the black darkness
we almost seem as though we should
step off into the abyss, right down on to
the swaying lights below us.</p>

<p>Such strange shadows are set dancing on
the road by the swaying lanterns we carry,
that Mousmé, who must, after all, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
seen such things dozens of times before,
clings closer to me for protection, and in a
low, frightened undertone she says:</p>

<p>“Cy-reel! Cy-reel! I am frightened! I
shall shut my eyes and take hold of you!”</p>

<p>But when I look down at her a few
paces further on, I see that it is but her
delightful coquetry; for her dark-brown
eyes, which in the lantern light have shadows
like a lake, are open, and are watching
Kotmasu, who is a little in advance of us
two.</p>

<p>She catches sight of me, and bursts out
laughing. She is never a bit ashamed of
being caught like this.</p>

<p>When once we reach the bottom of the
road, which runs past older houses even
than mine, villas mostly inhabited by the
better-class merchants and the few foreigners
who may have protracted business in
Nagasaki, we are plunged almost without
transition or warning into the heart and
life of the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>We go along the street, brightly illuminated
by hundreds of lanterns, pendent
and ambulatory, at some small risk of being
run over by <i lang="ja">rikishas</i> taken at a rapid,
nay, almost reckless pace by their active
drawers.</p>

<p>Mousmé walks along quite gaily, her
wooden clogs making a great clatter on
the stones which crop up in the street, in
concert with those of scores of other women
who are out with husbands, brothers or
escorts for an evening’s amusement or stroll.
She is so naïvely proud of her “English
sir,” who is a real husband after all.</p>

<p>We go through the streets, which at
night seem all the same, all gaily lit with
flaring oil-lamps, and illuminated with
countless numbers of paper lanterns, which
throw a mellow-coloured radiance on the
faces of the passers-by; looking in this
shop and that as we walk slowly along.</p>

<p>The sense of possession is very strong in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Mousmé. Every now and again she
clutches my hand or arm—though, strictly
speaking, to do so is not Japanese etiquette—and
fires off little nods to acquaintances.
Every clutch at the sleeve
of my coat means that she has caught sight
of some one to whom she wishes to exhibit
me as her real husband. When Kotmasu,
who is a wonderful recounter of tales relating
to those we meet and nod to, laughingly
reproaches her with indecorousness,
she says:</p>

<p>“What you say well enough; but I
Engleesh now, you know,” with a <i lang="fr">moue</i>
and a little quick turn of her dainty head,
which makes both of us laugh, and the
passers-by stare in astonishment at our
sudden merriment.</p>

<p>Yes, Mousmé is so English—in everything
except what really constitutes Englishness.
What a revelation England will
be to her, and she to my respected relatives!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>These streets we walk through are wonderful.
They are all alike; the houses, of
frailest woodwork and paper panelling,
are scarcely varied in any particular, save
that of ornamentation, from one end of the
long row to the other. There are no shop
fronts, no glass windows; so that intending
purchasers, or even those who have no
intentions other than curiosity, can take up
the various articles so openly displayed,
and examine them at their leisure.</p>

<p>This is what Mousmé delights in doing.
She likes best the shops in which rich
dress fabrics and women’s ornaments play
an important part.</p>

<p>A tiny parcel, done up neatly in rice-paper,
betrays the fact that she has already
coaxed me into purchasing “a little
present.” The shopkeepers, who squat in
the midst of their wares, offer no objection
to Mousmé’s inspection; and as it amuses
her, why should I mind?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>As we go along towards the lower and
harbour end of the town, the crowd of
people gets denser and denser. If the
terrors of horses—Nagasaki is as guiltless
of horses as Venice itself—driven or ridden,
were added to the <i lang="ja">djin</i>-harnessed
<i lang="ja">rikishas</i>, one would walk along at momentary
risk of annihilation.</p>

<p>But the <i lang="ja">djins</i> are wonderfully active
and intelligent, and avoid obstacles with
marvellous ability. There are few corns
in Japan, and the wheel of a <i lang="ja">rikisha</i> over
one’s feet, therefore, is of somewhat less
moment.</p>

<p>Mousmé flutters along at my side, chattering
in Japanese, and English of a sort,
gay and contented, her sense of the ludicrous
being aroused every now and then
by the sight of one or other of her countrymen
in the garb of civilization—Western
civilization, that is. A Japanese in European
attire in Europe may be an artistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
mistake; in Japan an inartistic atrocity.
There are several of these about, in out-of-date
pot-hats, and tail-coats of the year
before last’s cut. Even Kotmasu, who
himself is attached to pseudo-European
attire, laughs at them. How queer they
look!—the pot-hat <i lang="la">cum</i> a fringe of black,
shining hair beneath its brim, and other
really picturesque garments.</p>

<p>We are getting tired, and Mousmé’s
natural lust of buying useless things is
increasing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, she has been told I am
“one very much rich man.” Kotmasu—who
is beginning to pine for the <i lang="ja">geishas</i>—and I
have our arms uncomfortably full of purchases——little
lacquer boxes, fantastic
hair-combs and pins, silk sashes, a tiny
silver tobacco-pipe with tortoises, frogs
and tiny lizards scarcely bigger than a
pin’s head crawling up the chased stem,
boxes of plums preserved in sugar, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
French bonbons purchased at a ruinous
price. All this is very strange, and even
Mousmé’s recklessness is charming, captivating.</p>

<p>There is no time for the theatre now,
so Mousmé and I make our way to a tea-house,
and Kotmasu, who has been such a
long-suffering companion of our peregrinations,
goes off to see the <i lang="ja">geishas</i>, and, I
fear, a somewhat improper variety entertainment.</p>

<p>The <i lang="ja">chaya</i> is full of its patrons. Such
a crowd of mousmés and their escorts; and
very few of the crimson-and-gold covered
<i lang="ja">futons</i> (cushions), which are negligently
arranged for the use of the guests under
the verandah overlooking the garden, are
vacant. So we step out into the garden,
and enter a quaintly constructed summer-house
built to accommodate two.</p>

<p>We have scarcely seated ourselves, after
my having drawn aside the paper shutters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
on the garden side, ere a charming little
scrap of an attendant mousmé, with a
dress of yellow silk and scarlet satin <i lang="ja">obi</i>,
presents herself to take our orders.</p>

<p>She stands in the lantern-light just
outside the doorway, caressing her knees
with her tiny hands, and smiling and showing
her pretty teeth in anticipation of receiving
a “good order.”</p>

<p>After a hurried consultation with
Mousmé, who says, “Sugar plums!
Oranges! Tea!” the little gay-hued waitress
flits away in search of what we have
ordered.</p>

<p>The garden, of which the owner is so
proud that he calls it that of “The Hundred
Beautiful Lights,” is a quaintly
pretty one. Just behind our little summer-house,
with its octagon roof of thin
split laths of mahogany and paper <i lang="ja">shoji</i>,
with French-grey backgrounds adorned
with country views by a local artist who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
has shamefully overlooked all the canons
of perspective, are lotus-ponds—tiny, toy-like
expanses of water in which doubtless
the inevitable gold-fish swim and mouth
for air bubbles; miniature waterfalls,
stone votive lamps, and grotesquely trained
trees, dwarfed by some strange process to
accord with the minuteness of their surroundings.</p>

<p>Whilst we are observing all these
things, and the now blossomless wisterias
in their belated garb of light green, our
mousmé returns, staggering along with two
huge iron candlesticks three feet high, one
in each hand, which are to light us at our
feast. With great exactitude, she sticks
two wax candles upon their respective
spikes, and lights them; and then vanishes,
like the genie of the lamp, to carry out
further bidding.</p>

<p>Although the garden and tea-house were
so full of patrons, we had not long to wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
for our refreshments. Our mousmé knew
that I was English—not, of, course, a difficult
matter; and to be English spells generosity
in Japanese eyes in the matter of
<i lang="ja">sen</i> for her own little pocket. So we were
waited on quickly.</p>

<p>In a few minutes we seemed positively
surrounded by tiny dishes and plates.</p>

<p>As an Irish gentleman who came to
Japan for three months, and made my acquaintance,
once said, “Everything relating
to meals is so singularly numerous.”</p>

<p>This exactly puts it.</p>

<p>We had ordered a simple enough meal,
in all conscience, and yet we were literally
surrounded by it.</p>

<p>Mousmé sipped her light-coloured tea,
which was suffused with cherry blossoms,
with the air of a princess, and behaved as
a great lady. At any rate the attendant
mousmé should clearly understand that she
was not like the party of <i lang="ja">geishas</i> over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
there in the brilliantly lighted pagoda near
the balcony, who were entertaining and
being entertained by some of the gilded
youths of Nagasaki.</p>

<p>“What a noise they make!” exclaims
Mousmé with a smile of pitying disgust.
“Their laugh is as hollow as a drum, and
they sing because they must. They will
be with some one else to-morrow night,
and the next, and the next. While,” and
the expression of Mousmé’s face changes
and grows very soft and tender, “I have
always you.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, always me,” I answer, taking her
hand that she has rested on my knee
whilst talking.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p>Next morning I awoke early, roused
by the twittering of grass sparrows and
the weakened croak of a frog, hoarse from
its vocal efforts of the night.</p>

<p>It was New Year’s day, and the sun
was streaming through the open windows.
Mousmé had already crept from her white
mattress beneath the smoke-blue mosquito
curtains, and was doubtless sunning herself,
after a hasty toilet, in the wonderful
garden which we had fashioned out of the
rocks and red-brown soil.</p>

<p>I stretched sleepily, and wondered
vaguely what they were doing in England,
and whether my estimable, though trying,
sister Lou (fashionable to her finger-tips)
had cajoled my unfortunate brother-in-law
into changing her last year’s set of furs
for “something a little more the thing,
don’t you know, Stanmere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Mousmé requires no furs. Her wants
are few. A piece of silk with wonderful
patterns over it—birds which seem to fly,
irises whose vivid tints almost make
unaccustomed eyes ache, and chrysanthemums
which one could swear nod
upon their slender, almost leafless stalks—which
she fashions into a robe of delight.
A few jade and lacquer pins for her
wonderful jet-black hair. Some new <i lang="ja">tabi</i>.
Long white digitated stockings reaching
above her dimpled knees. A sash to
make her girl acquaintances and married
brother’s wife jealous. And so you have
the costume in which she is prepared to
receive her visitors and to glide with a
soothing shish-shish over the white matting
of the floor and through the comically
narrow passages.</p>

<p>The mail arrived yesterday week, and
down at Kotmasu’s office I found Lou’s
usual parcel of New Year’s gifts. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
me there were several new novels—the
pictures in which will cause Mousmé to
wonder and open her almond eyes wide,
with the little trick of quivering the lids
which she has—some papers, tobacco—five
pounds of it in a sealed tin (a good soul
is Stanmere)—a shaving tidy worked by
Irene in some mysterious stitch which
seems to have come into fashion since I
scorned crewel-work anti-macassars with
lace frills that hung on the back buttons
of one’s coat, turning one at afternoon tea
into an object of interest and amusement.</p>

<p>For Mousmé there was a Paris hat
(Lou will never, I fear, realise that Paris
fashions have as yet little interest for
Nagasaki belles), in which Mousmé’s
piquant face would be smothered and
turned to no account, a silk tea-gown
which she will wear with the dignity
becoming five feet one inch and a half of
really married Japanese womanhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>There was also something more.</p>

<p>My present, which I have had sent
out from the Compagnie des Fondants
Parisiens—a huge box of the best confectionery
that money could buy. I
knew that Mousmé would like this better
than anything else, and that for the time
the native <i lang="ja">teriyaki</i> and such-like sugar-coated
joys would be nowhere.</p>

<p>All the presents are in the little room
I use as a study—a room into which
Mousmé creeps with awe. It is (to her
untutored mind) so full of books and
mysterious writings.</p>

<p>I had risen and was gazing out over
the harbour, which lay below me veiled
in a gauze-like, opalescent haze, when the
farther paper-panelled door was slid softly
back in its groove, and Mousmé entered.</p>

<p>A quaint little figure with the flush of
dawn transferred to her porcelain cheeks
and eyes bright with the early morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
air of the scented garden; her elaborate
coiffure, with its many pins, a striking
contrast to the <i lang="fr">négligée</i> of her plum-coloured
<i lang="ja">kimono</i> with its sprays of bamboo
in gold thread. Against her bare little
throat and dimpled shoulders she pressed
a wealth of iris and lotus blooms and
tender green shoots of the slenderest
bamboo, her face peeping out elfish and
smiling from the midst.</p>

<p>“These are for you, Cy-reel,” she said,
laughing and casting the brilliant blossoms
on to the floor in a patch of sunlight at my
feet. “Now den what have you for me?”</p>

<p>It is difficult to resist Mousmé when
she pulls one’s face down to her own
smiling one, and throws slender but
wonderfully tenacious little arms round
one’s neck.</p>

<p>Mousmé, since she married, has lost some
of the shyness for the “velly much rich
Englishman” who had so strange a fancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
as to marry her right away, and in its
place has come the knowledge of certain
privileges of her sex (for she knows little
as yet of the “advanced” woman), and she
exacts them with a pretty persistence which
I find charming.</p>

<p>We went along the passage to the room
in which are all the presents. They have
been taken out of their case, and piled with
masculine breadth of effect upon two low
lacquer-and-bamboo settees in a corner
near one of the windows.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” exclaimed Mousmé, and
then she fell down before this wonderful
collection of gifts, her tiny hands fluttering
over them like those of a child uncertain
which thing to touch first.</p>

<p>Irene’s shaving tidy, the tin of tobacco
sent by Stanmere, Lou’s gift of books—all
these things are brushed aside, and the
wonderful pale blue tea-gown is at last
taken up. It is absurdly long for her, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
course, and as she slipped into it she
laughed softly at the comical figure she
presented.</p>

<p>“It is velly nice, I like it. But it must
be cut off. You cannot come near me with
all this on the floor.”</p>

<p>She glided once or twice across the
room, like a big-winged moth, with the soft
sound of silk frou-frou on the matting, and
then the gown was laid aside, so that she
might more easily find the other presents.</p>

<p>Then the box of fondants was discovered.
What rapture! Smiles stole over her face.
Her little fingers trembled when she at
last made up her mind to undo the satin
ribbon, which, crossing from corner to corner,
is tied in a great bow in the centre of
the lid. There are wonderful sweets of
all sorts, things which Mousmé almost
fears to taste, and which when once tasted
encourage her to further depredations and
experiments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mousmé, you’ll be ill.”</p>

<p>“No, Cy-reel, not nearly so sweet and
ill-producing as <i lang="ja">teriyaki</i>.”</p>

<p>I laughed at the gentle sophistry and
suggested that we should go to breakfast.</p>

<p>After the meal a huge bullock-cart came
along the road which runs at the foot of
our sloping garden. It is laden with New
Year’s gifts to tempt those who have put
off the inevitable spending of sen and yen
till the last possible moment.</p>

<p>Mousmé drew me along the garden path,
past the iris pond, in the shade of which
gold-fish are keeping New Year’s day on
a fly-and-mosquito diet, to the side of the
cart. The proprietors in new suits are
explaining the merits of their wares, which
are cheapened enormously as at Western
“sale” times. A light air stirred the paper
lanterns with which the cart was decked.</p>

<p>One represented a huge gold-fish with a
gold and vermilion body and fins boldly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
sketched in black. It took Mousmé’s fancy.
We purchased it, and earned the absurdly
exaggerated thanks of the smiling vendors,
knowing the while that we did not require
it, and that it would be placed with a
score of others, hung on their slight bamboo
rods, in the cupboard at the end of
the passage.</p>

<p>Some night, perhaps, unless another
lantern comes more easily to hand, we
might take it out to guide us on our way
down to the <i lang="ja">chaya</i> at which the best
<i lang="ja">geishas</i> dance.</p>

<p>During the whole of the morning we
were expectant. Before sunset many of
Mousmé’s numerous relations will have
called to wish us New Year joys: and my
respected, if too effusive, mother-in-law
will have once more asked me if I am
satisfied with her daughter.</p>

<p>She even yet seems to think that her
daughter is on approval, and liable at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
time to be returned with liquidated damages
in the form of an extra handsome
<i lang="ja">kimono</i> from Nara-Ya’s famous store on
the Bund. Everyone calls on everyone,
and after mid-day we are not long left
without visitors.</p>

<p>Kotmasu turned up in good time. He
brought Mousmé the tiny dog she has been
longing for. A charming present, which
she will almost want to wear round her
neck with a chain, lest it be lost.</p>

<p>It was only when our little home almost
trembled and our garden seemed to swarm
with the incursion of Mousmé’s relatives
that I realised how throughly I was
married. By the time the sun had commenced
its downward flight into the sea
behind the hills, many had arrived, and
little moon-faced Aki had taken the usual
and seemingly inevitable plunge into the
water-lily pond in search of the sprites who
are supposed to dwell therein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>These obsequious relatives by marriage
amuse me immensely. They all take so
much <i lang="fr">au sérieux</i>. But how truly polite
they all are. Even the sampanman (a
cousin of whom Mousmé is not quite sure)
is a polished gentleman, and the new suit
with which he has managed to start the
year, with the manners thrown in, gave
him quite a distinguished air. I noticed
that the box of sweets was reserved by
Mousmé for those who were drinking tea,
surrounded by many plates and cups—the
favoured few, mostly girl friends.</p>

<p>If only I might have believed the charming
prevarications of my relatives, how
beautiful everything belonging to me
must have been.</p>

<p>At length the last of them disappeared
down the road. And the paper lanterns,
whose dull white surfaces challenge the
moon swinging in the sky above the
amethyst hills, swung round the corner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Mousmé waved her hand sympathetically,
and then we sat down together on the
veranda to watch the last hours of a New
Year’s Day glide into the æons of the past.</p>

<p class="tb">One day is so very much like another to
me in this strange land, where I have the
lightest of business duties to perform, few
friends other than Kotmasu, and no great
desire to gain any more, though I find the
natives I know vastly more interesting than
the few English who are settled more or less
permanently in Nagasaki for business or
other purposes.</p>

<p>Everything has a certain charm—Mousmé
always—but four long years have
robbed my surroundings of that subtlest of
all interests, novelty. I am eager to test
my experiment, which is answering here
so admirably, with a new environment.</p>

<p>“Mousmé in Bond Street.” Kotmasu’s
phrase haunts me with a sinister purpose,
but I am not to be daunted easily, for I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
my own opinions. Have I not? I ask
myself.</p>

<p>I remember the Frenchman who, with
some delicacy, sums up the question of
marriage in every clime where any ceremony
is attached to the rite: “Given a
woman and one possesses the possibility
of great happiness—or its exact antithesis,”
and I am thankful that my experiment so
far has resulted well.</p>

<p>Mousmé is neither the serpent nor the
eel of another French writer’s experience,
but is always fresh, always charming. She
is a graduate in the art of pleasing. She
knows nothing further of astronomy than
to suspect that the stars are really big diamonds,
nor of mathematics than what generally
enables her to make a good bargain for
an <i lang="ja">obi</i>, dress or hairpin. Hers are entirely
applied mathematics, and of the simplest
kind. All this ignorance is very stupid,
no doubt, to you. I can well imagine the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
smile of the Girton girl or “superior person”
which will reward my confession of
Mousmé’s ignorance, but then you are at a
disadvantage—in short, you do not know
Mousmé as I do. She has lately taken
to writing me love-letters whilst I am
away down in the town, and when she is
tired of trying to read what is printed underneath
the pictures in the papers and
magazines—queer narrow little strips of
letters, folded ever so many times, which
she places in her prettiest envelopes, and
lays upon my writing-desk; then hides behind
a paper screen, or in the next room,
to watch me unobserved whilst I read
them.</p>

<p>Of course, she could tell me all that they
contain, and often does; but Mousmé is
quite a child in some things—the blending
of childishness with womanhood, which is
one of her most delightful traits.</p>

<p>There are such quaint turns of expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
in these rice-paper billets-doux, which
by turns bring smiles and tears into my
eyes, such naïve confessions, such strange
lapses into her limited vocabulary of English
words.</p>

<p>To-day there is one of those notes on my
writing-table, in a shrimp-pink envelope,
on which is depicted a dainty little <i lang="ja">geisha</i>
dancing in one corner. There is a rather
strong air—I cannot call it a wind, or even
breeze—stirring; and Mousmé, fearful lest
the treasury of her love should be blown
away, has weighed it down with the bronze
frog I use for a paper-weight, which she
made me buy as an ornament (!) for my
table the other day.</p>

<p>I take the little letter up, of course, with
the knowledge that Mousmé’s eye is upon
me from some near retreat, from which she
can steal forth silently to kiss me, English
fashion; or startle me with some sudden
noise, in imitation of the mice which scamper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
about in the basement at night, or
with a mimicry of the strange <em>han! han!</em>
of the vultures which whirl, screaming
hoarsely and as if in complaint, over the
water of the harbour below.</p>

<p>Mousmé comes out softly from her hiding-place
behind the turquoise-blue paper
screen in the corner, unaware that two tell-tale
glasses, her big one (which she soon
made me purchase for her) and my little
one, have from their juxtaposition long
ago betrayed to me the secret of her whereabouts.</p>

<p>Two soft white arms, bare to the elbows,
encircle my neck suddenly from behind; a
pretty, piquant face appears over my left
shoulder, and—well, after a time, when we
stand up and look at each other, there is a
peal of gay, spontaneous laughter. And,
behold! there is a tell-tale patch of white
upon my cheek and coat where her face
has rested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>It is several days since we have been
anywhere—that is, further afield than a
flying visit to my mother-in-law down the
hill—and to-night we are going to the <i lang="fr">fête</i>
at the great temple away up the hillside.
I have been to such before, but Mousmé is
crazy to go with her real husband; and as
there is certainly no valid objection to urge
against her desire, we are going.</p>

<p>Mousmé puts the little shrimp-coloured
love-letter in a box on top of the numerous
others she has written me during our three
months of married life, and then we sit
down to a dinner of the usual perplexing
dishes.</p>

<p>We talk gaily enough in Japanese,
Mousmé describing to me all the delights
she is anticipating from the proposed excursion,
and telling me all that has occurred
during my two hours’ absence.</p>

<p>What a charming little vis-a-vis she
proves as we, seated on our squares of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
spotless matting, pretend to make a good
meal off impossible dishes, as to the constituents
of which, even now, after some
years of experience, I am frequently in
mysterious doubt! Oka, our cook, is of
an inventive turn of mind, and to-day he
serves on the tiny blue plates wee potatoes
<i lang="fr">à la marrons glacés</i>, and cherries in vinegar!
But Mousmé pronounces them a
success, and insists on leaning across the
elaborate square of magenta silk worked
with white cranes fishing, which she has
instituted as a tribute to European ideas of
a table-cloth, to put the larger of the cherries
in my mouth on the end of a chop-stick.
All this is very frivolous, doubtless;
but very charming. To be anything but
gay with such make-believe surroundings,
and Mousmé sitting opposite playful and
smiling, would be out of place. I assert
this to myself whenever the thought of
Lou crosses my mind. I am compelled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
do so to lay the ghost of Lou’s outraged
sense of propriety, for, truth to tell, she is
very proper over some things, a somewhat
hide-bound devotee of society etiquette
with the responsibilities of a rapidly upgrowing
daughter.</p>

<p>What a child Mousmé is! And yet
there is an indefinable charm inseparable
from womanhood about her. She was
pouting just now because the camellia she
had stuck in the front of her gown had
fallen in a shower of scarlet petals into a
tiny cup of tea on her knees. Now she is
smiling again, and giving herself a lesson
in English.</p>

<p>“Cy-reel! Cy-reel!” She always seems
to practise this first; and then, “I luv yew.
I luv yew velly much.” This over and
over again, till we both burst out laughing,
and the scene ends in the usual way.</p>

<p>At present our life is a dainty <i lang="fr">comédie à
deux</i>, and is nothing approaching the farce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
with its underlying tragic note which
timorous Kotmasu feared and predicted.</p>

<p>Soon after sunset we start out—Mousmé
and I—to make our way to the temple.
The moon swims up rapidly into the cloud-clear
vault of heaven, and floods our
scented garden with a pure silver radiance.
We have our paper lanterns all the same,
although in competition with the strong
white moonbeams they look almost trumpery.</p>

<p>Our garden, with its narrow paths and
tangled vegetation, is full of exquisite perfumes
released by the blossoming flowers,
scents wafted under one’s nostrils by the
faintest breath of air, which causes the
full-blown tea-roses to shiver and then
shatter in a hail of falling petals.</p>

<p>As we turn the corner of the path near
the largest of our several fountains, we look
back (as we always do) at our home. The
door-panels of the rooms leading on to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
verandah are open, and I can see right into
our bed-chamber. On its bracket a little
lamp is burning, and near it Mousmé has
placed a tiny image of Buddha—an ivory
god with a fixed smile. She does not pray
to it now, however. I am vaguely conscious
that I have ousted the ivory Buddha
from its temple. Why Mousmé keeps it
there I have been as yet unable to discover.
How strange it seems to leave the whole
side of one’s house open after dark! Ere
we step out on to the road through the
bamboo wicket with its quaintly chased
brass hinges, I take one more look back,
and see Oka’s wife with her funny little
squat figure pass along the verandah on
her way to tidy the rooms.</p>

<p>Mousmé is charmingly dressed to-night
in a peach-coloured silk gown, so stiff and
rich, and an amber-yellow sash. Her hair
is done into a marvellous butterfly, and her
head is full of half a score of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
handsome of her many pins. The moonlight
gives a silver sheen to her ebon locks;
and did I not know how black they are, I
might have a chill come to my heart because
of Mousmé’s getting grey.</p>

<p>We make our way as rapidly as we can
down into the town.</p>

<p>Long before we arrive at the commencement
of the town proper we are made aware
that the <i lang="fr">fête</i> is in full swing by the sounds
of gaiety, the blaze of lanterns which is
reflected above the town as if there were a
conflagration, and the softened, confused
roar of the thronging multitudes in the
streets.</p>

<p>We reach the end of the street at last,
and Mousmé is almost torn from my arm
by the crowd by which we are immediately
absorbed.</p>

<p>Every one is gay and good-humoured.
I tread upon some one’s heels, but he only
smiles, and assures me that my “honourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
feet” have not hurt his humble heel.
My toes are trodden on in turn, Mousmé
laughs, and even I, the injured party, do
not remonstrate. Indeed, I almost say,
“<i lang="ja">Gomen navai</i>,” as though I were the
offender and do murmur politely—“It is
no matter”—that is all I reply to the polite
speech with which the offender asks
pardon.</p>

<p>Mousmé is used to this, and she pilots
me amid this bewildering blaze of ambulatory
lanterns, swaying recklessly on the
ends of their quivering sticks.</p>

<p>The moving crowds of women and girls
diffuse a subtle perfume from the flowers
they wear in their dresses and hair.
Mousmés in the brilliant colours of their
gayest holiday attire jostle one another
good-humouredly—laughing, thoughtless
little souls. The men are seemingly suffering
from a bad attack of “European
fever,” as is indicated by the frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
presence of the top-hat or “bowler” above
their amiable though unbeautiful faces,
and the occasional presence of trousers beneath
their skirt-like robes.</p>

<p>Alas! just as we near the temple, the
pressure of the throng drives us into the
proximity of my mother-in-law, and little
Aki, who is carrying high above his queer
shaven head, with its one tuft of hair
or rather fringe—which is like nothing
so much as the traditional chimney-sweep’s
circular broom—a lantern, like the banner
in “Excelsior,” “with a strange device”—a
most quaintly hideous imp.</p>

<p>Mother-in-law is too busy protecting one
of my “handsome presents,” a ruby-coloured
silken <i lang="ja">obi</i>, from contamination with
the crowd, to notice us. But I quickly
perceive that Aki’s narrow slots of eyes
have spied us out, for the imp-like lantern
sways violently upon its stick as he pushes
his way through the dense crowd towards
us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>We are so hedged in that escape is impossible
even if we wished; but Mousmé
has a <i lang="fr">penchant</i> for this queer little brother
with his intelligent monkey-face and ever-present
smile.</p>

<p>She, too, has caught sight of the struggling
Aki, who at times seems swallowed
up in the crowd, as though never to reappear.
But he does. And we can see him
working an eel-like course towards the
fluttering banner under which he doubtless
noticed we were standing.</p>

<p>He reaches us at last, and advertises the
fact by unconsciously swinging his imp
lantern into my face.</p>

<p>Mousmé bursts out laughing, and so do I—merriment
is so infectious; and in a
moment the people near us are laughing too.</p>

<p>Aki is delighted, and seizes hold of a
hand of mine and one of Mousmé’s, and we
advance along the street a little further.</p>

<p>The shops we pass are simply blazing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
with lights. They have stall-like extensions,
encroaching upon the roadway, all
of them piled up with astonishing sweetmeats
of brilliant hues, toys, flowers, and
hideously grotesque masks.</p>

<p>Aki is so attracted by the latter that we
make scarcely any progress. Mousmé, who
is getting impatient, makes a brilliant suggestion.</p>

<p>“Cy-reel, buy Aki a mask. He will
never cease gazing at them or come along
if you don’t. And we shall never reach
the temple. No one can see my <i lang="ja">obi</i> and
dress here.”</p>

<p>I laugh quietly to myself at this last
remark. The woman had popped out unwittingly.</p>

<p>I buy my little brother-in-law a most
monstrous head. He is in raptures, and
Mousmé and I are in convulsions of laughter
at the hideous god into which little Aki is
at once transformed. We get on famously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
now, till his acquisitive eyes light upon a
pile of crystal trumpets.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaims Mousmé, as she sees
him pause, “he must have one.”</p>

<p>It is obvious that queer little Aki’s
heart is set upon possessing one of these
weirdly articulate instruments, so another
quarter of a <i lang="ja">yen</i> changes hands, and Aki
adds his quota to the unearthly, gobbling
sounds which dozens of these strange
instruments produce, blown by other
equally lusty-lunged boys.</p>

<p>The houses we pass by are all thrown
open, and decorated exquisitely with
flowers and foliage. It is a scene of fairy-like
beauty, and Mousmé at my side, upon
whom I have to look down to admire, is a
fairy.</p>

<p>She is getting tired; Aki is dragging on
her arm, and I am glad when the climb up
is done, and we are at last at the bottom
of the first flight of the temple steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Below us once more, as from our verandah
(only from a different and almost opposite
point) we see the town and the
land-locked bay flooded in a silver haze of
moonlight, which fails, however, to make
the crimson and golden reflection from the
thousands of lanterns less apparent.</p>

<p>The scene is like nothing that can be
imagined in beauty, and all around us appears
to be enveloped in a veil of impalpable
light.</p>

<p>We are close to the portico of the temple,
and we pass underneath it and enter
the courtyard, carried onward by the
pressure of the multitude from behind.</p>

<p>We pass two enormous white-and-blue
porcelain lanterns with encircling serpents
of mythological type, and then we are in
fairyland again.</p>

<p>Mousmé heaves a little sigh of delight;
her colour is deepened by the crimson of
excitement, and her eyes are dancing like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
fire-flies. Aki is lost, and we forget all
about him. He will be all right. There
are scores of other children straying about,
and no one seems to take any notice. Besides,
they mostly wear masks, and blow
intermittently upon crystal horns, the
noise of which reminds me of the irate
gobble-gobble of turkeys engaged in a
farmyard fracas.</p>

<p>“Cy-reel, is England like this?”
Mousmé asks in an excited whisper.</p>

<p>“No,” I am forced to admit, though
foreseeing the inevitable rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Then I don’t think I shall like England,”
says Mousmé the child.</p>

<p>“We shall see.”</p>

<p>We make our way to the terrace, bordered
by tea-houses, now thronged by the
beauties and golden youths of Nagasaki
and the country round. At every turn
we seem to meet some acquaintance of
Mousmé’s, who keeps up a continuous series
of bows and nods and smiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The grove of giant camellias, camphor-wood
trees, and cryptomerias stretch out
like a vast roof, the camellias covered with
a wealth of blood-red blossoms which, falling
in continuous showers in the vibrating
air, form a crimson carpet under the feet.
Even the dark recesses are luminous with
the flood of light which streams from the
lanterns and brilliantly illuminated interiors
of the tea-houses. We find seats at
last.</p>

<p>In an instant a mousmé with huge pins
in her hair, a humble smile, and gaily
rouged and whitened cheeks, brings us tiny
cups of tea.</p>

<p>Beyond and below us we can hear noises
which tell of the presence of side-shows,
wrestlers, mountebanks; and the roar of
approving audiences makes Mousmé hasten
to drink her tea and eat her beans in
sugar with the greatest possible speed.</p>

<p>When she has finished, we make our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
way along a terrace and take up our position
to form a part of the audience outside
a miniature theatre.</p>

<p>There is not much to see. What there
is would scarcely amuse any one less unsophisticated
in the Thespian art than the
Japanese. It is something like a shadow-show.
Only the horrible puppets which
appear and go through almost incomprehensible
antics are realities, which, in truly
terrifying masks, cause Mousmé what are
known as delightful “creeps,” and send
her hand clutching at my arm. The noises
from an orchestra of four or five which accompany
the doings of the characters, some
of which are a mixture of man and beast,
ghoul-like and given to sudden and unlooked-for
appearances and disappearances,
are weird and disquieting; of harmony the
musicians know nothing. Their colour
tones are all blues, greens, grays, and
bilious yellows; their merits, that they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
in accord with the impressions of the puppets.</p>

<p>We remain watching these human puppets
for some time, surrounded by a dense
crowd craning their necks, and on tip-toe
as each new shadow appears upon the
scene. Some of the antics of these
shadow-like forms are so monstrous that I
begin to think that Mousmé is getting
really frightened, and so I propose moving
on to where some clever tumblers, contortionists
and conjurers are to be seen.</p>

<p>“No,” says Mousmé, “let us go home.”</p>

<p>Then, seeing I do not quite understand
her desire, she explains with charming
<i lang="fr">naïveté</i> that she is afraid of bad dreams.</p>

<p>How queer, little Mousmé! and how
childlike, to be sure!</p>

<p>Mousmé’s words have made me notice
that the crowd is lessening in density, and
the lanterns are going out. Or is it they
are paling before the coming dawn?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>I look into the face of Mousmé, and then
into the faces of the people near us. Yes,
that is it. The moon is gone down into
the sea, and the sun will be climbing up
the first steps of another day’s journey ere
we arrive home.</p>

<p>We leave the terrace, with its lingering
crowds of tired-faced holiday-makers, and
fading light of lanterns and tea-houses, and
by a short cut gain a mountain-path leading
close home.</p>

<p>The sound of the trumpets is less and
less distinct, and that of the ever-chirping
cicalas more so, as we wend our way—Mousmé
and I—along the narrow, rough,
unpaved path in the rapidly growing dawn
of a Japanese morning.</p>

<p>Below us to the left lies the town as yet
indistinct in the slowly increasing light,
a mysterious mass of shadows and projections
which mark the places of streets
and roofs of houses. Here and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
twinkle yellowish red points of light which
grow dimmer each moment in the quickening
dawn. The harbour stretches a mist-obscured
expanse, with gaps here and
there like chrysoprases laid in cotton wool.
Soon the shipping will become visible, and
the mist roll off the face of the tranquil
water, like a gauze curtain lifted by unseen
hands.</p>

<p>The path runs between fields of flowers,
and is edged with dewy grass. The perfume
of the blossoms and the keen freshness
of the morning air arouse Mousmé’s
almost slumbering senses. Through the
indescribable fragrance and glamour of an
Eastern dawn we wend our way homewards
slowly and with tired feet.</p>

<p>The women, in blue cotton garments,
are already coming up to work in the fields.
Good-looking children accompanying them
chase each other across the dew-spangled
grass, trampling under foot flowers which
would have graced a palace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>At last we have walked up the little
garden path, slippery now with the morning
exhalations. Indoors all are asleep.
Everywhere is quiet.</p>

<p>But no matter. When Mousmé has
drowsily mounted the verandah steps we
have only to enter our little house, which
looks so lonely and mysterious at this early
hour, by pushing aside one of those sliding
paper panels; to cross the creaking floor
covered with spotlessly clean matting; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
then fall asleep in two minutes on the soft,
mosquito-guarded mattress, lulled, if we
need a lullaby, by Oka’s muffled snores
down below.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p>It is nearly a month since our night of
pleasure at the temple <i lang="fr">fête</i> of the thousands
of lanterns, and I have been in terrible
trouble.</p>

<p>Something has happened to Mousmé,
and till that catastrophe—to me it seemed
nothing less—I never realized what she
was to me.</p>

<p>It was so sudden.</p>

<p>I had left her in the morning, bright as
the sunshine which forced its way through
the bamboo and paper <i lang="ja">shoji</i>, and, filtering
thus, fell in golden, thread-like rays like
spun silk upon the floor. The last I saw
of her was a tiny figure upon the balcony
as I turned the corner of the road, blowing
kisses to me with one hand, and waving a
huge bunch of crimson lotus in the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
flowers we had just gathered together in
the sun-bathed garden.</p>

<p>And in three or four hours all this was
altered, obliterated.</p>

<p>I climbed up from the town leisurely,
taking the shady side of the road, and
availing myself to the full of every shadow
cast by the trees or by the queer old villas
with their mossy roofs and eccentric architecture.
If I had but known, how my
steps would have hastened!</p>

<p>Arrived at the wicket, I cannot see even
a flutter of Mousmé’s dress to-day. She is
usually awaiting my return in the shady
corner of the verandah with her <i lang="ja">samisen</i>,
or with a pile of books at her side, from
which she has been trying to spell out the
words in big print.</p>

<p>I walk up the path, which is flower-bordered,
and alive with bees whose humming
sounds are like the deeper notes of
an Æolian harp, and across the garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
where dragon-flies flit, iridescent shuttles
weaving their colours, blue, green and
yellow, into the sunlit air, darting between
the little ponds in which gold-fish hide
from the sunlight beneath the tranquil
floating lotus-leaves.</p>

<p>I enter the house. Everything is
strangely still.</p>

<p>There is no one in the room in which we
usually sit. The blue-and-white vases of
Arita porcelain are filled with lotus-blooms,
dainty, fantastic in their arrangement, with
spiked grasses and sedges. A tiny vase
of bronze stands upon my writing-table.
As usual, dear little Mousmé has placed in
it the finest blossoms, and in their rose-hued
cups I fancy some of her kisses may
lurk. Her shoes are standing in a patch
of sunlight on the floor. “She cannot
have gone out, then,” I say to myself.
“It is evident that she is not down at
mother-in-law’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Where is she?</p>

<p>I push back one of the panels to enter
the next room. Perhaps she is there.</p>

<p>The room is so dark that I can scarcely
see across it; but in the dimness I can just
discern a something stretched upon the
floor.</p>

<p>I step hastily forward.</p>

<p>Yes, it is Mousmé lying there, with her
face, upturned, looking a white, featureless
oval in the gloom, her gown elongating her
slender figure, and her huge sleeves of blue
flowered silk with orange linings spread
out like the maimed wings of a brilliant,
long-bodied moth.</p>

<p>I stoop down.</p>

<p>Is she asleep? No, but she is terribly
still. Is it a coquettish ruse on her part,
and will she open her eyes in a minute or
two, and burst out laughing in my face,
and then pull it down for a shower of
kisses from her rosebud mouth?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Half expecting this, I wait an instant,
and feel as if I were kneeling beside my
own grave. But the fantastic little figure
I love so well gives no sign of movement.
My alarm increases. I get up, hastily
push back one of the sliding paper panels,
and let in a flood of sunlight from the
garden.</p>

<p>It streams full on Mousmé’s face; it
searches out the gold threads in the embroidery
of her gown; it tells me in an instant
that there is something seriously
wrong.</p>

<p>There are no bells in this strange little
house of mine, so I beat upon the floor
with my heel to summon Oka or his wife.</p>

<p>I wait anxiously, kneeling beside silent
little Mousmé. Each second seems to extend
itself into an hour. How long it
seems—that minute or two ere I can hear
some one ascending the rickety stairs from
the basement. It is Oka’s wife who enters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
her eyes still but half unfastened
from an interrupted siesta.</p>

<p>She comes forward to where I am kneeling
beside Mousmé.</p>

<p>Unlike women of her class in England,
Oka’s wife is laconic.</p>

<p>“Fever,” she says, on catching sight of
Mousmé’s face. “Send for the doctor
very quick!” She is evidently waiting
for me to give my assent to her suggestion,
so I nod my head, and she goes away softly
across the room.</p>

<p>A few minutes later I hear one of her
numerous progeny go away down the path
at a run, and I know the doctor has been
sent for.</p>

<p>Mousmé remains unconscious all the
time that we are getting her partially undressed
and on to the mattress.</p>

<p>Am I to lose her?</p>

<p>The bare thought drives the blood away
from my heart. I know what Kotmasu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
would say, for he still disbelieves, or at
least pretends to disbelieve, in my marriage.</p>

<p>“There are velly plenty more mousmés.”</p>

<p>“Yes, very well,” something inside my
mind replies, “but only one Mousmé.”</p>

<p>Whilst we wait the coming of Han Sen,
the doctor, I am driven almost frantic by
the noises which one can never shut out of
a Japanese house. The droning hum of
the bees at work on the roses outside, the
unceasing chirruping whirr of the cicalas,
all the sounds of a garden in summer-time,
are magnified tenfold because I fear that
Mousmé will be disturbed.</p>

<p>She uncloses her eyes once when the
doctor’s steps are heard coming up the garden-path.
But she says nothing, and only
takes my large brown hand in her small
one.</p>

<p>I have not much faith in the doctor.
His phials are so finikin and toy-like, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
I have heard something, too, about their
drugs, and my memory of their fantastic
and extraordinary nature does not tend to
reassure me.</p>

<p>He is a little, oldish man with gimlet
eyes in a face full of wrinkles, which seem
to serve no other purpose than to disguise
his emotions if he has any. He treads
softly across the matting floor, with Oka’s
wife hovering, anxious-faced, in the rear.</p>

<p>“Madame the most honourable lady has
been unwell some time?” he inquires in a
high-pitched key, with an insinuating inflection
on the first word, which many
people annoy me with when referring to
Mousmé.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“No!” and his eyebrows depart upward
from overhanging his narrow, beady
black eyes.</p>

<p>“Her illness dates but from an hour or
two ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, then she will get better, most
honourable English Mister,” is the reply.
And then, whilst I am explaining matters,
the doctor’s yellow fingers, with their
wrinkled, dried-parchment skin, are busy
compounding something which smells
abominably, and in the efficacy of which I
feel I have no faith, notwithstanding his
reiterated assurance that “the most honourable
madame” will speedily recover.</p>

<p>When he has finished mixing the medicine
in the little jar-like cup Oka’s wife
has brought him, he examines his patient
very carefully with a pair of spectacles
thrust up on his forehead, holding Mousmé’s
hand and counting the pulse-beats,
lifting her eyelids and staring into her unseeing
eyes, talking all the while in the
high-pitched, squeaky tone which reminds
me of the old man who sits at the corner
of Nisson Street and writes the illiterate
mousmés’ love-letters, putting in all sorts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of dreadful things in response to the usual,
“You know what to say,” of his unimaginative
clients.</p>

<p>When Dr. Han Sen has finished the examination,
and has listened with a stethoscope
of native manufacture to the beating
of Mousmé’s heart, to the bird-like fluttering
of which I am so used in the wakeful
stillness of the night, he rises to go.</p>

<p>Shall he come to see the most honourable
lady to-morrow?</p>

<p>A vague idea formulates itself as I look
into his unintelligent, vacuous face.</p>

<p>“No, I will send if I want your services,”
I hastily explain.</p>

<p>“No?” There is a look of almost professional
regret on the wizened face. Do
I know my most honourable madame is ill,
very ill?</p>

<p>“Yes! I know. I will send if I require
the most honourable Dr. Han Sen.”</p>

<p>Then he goes out down the path, no
doubt mystified at my eccentric conduct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>What a fool I was not to have thought
of this before!</p>

<p>As soon as Dr. Han Sen has had time to
get clear of the garden, I hasten off down
into Nagasaki, leaving Mousmé, who is
evidently sleeping now, in charge of Oka’s
wife.</p>

<p>I am going to get the European doctor
of the mail-boat to come and see her.</p>

<p>“Why did not I think of this before?”
I ask myself as I hasten over the roughly
paved roadway down the hillside towards
the harbour. Ah! why, indeed, not?</p>

<p>Mousmé was very ill, and at one time I
watched beside her day and night, fearing
every hour, nay, almost every moment, lest
the frail thread of life should be snapped,
and the sun of my happiness go down with
that of her life.</p>

<p>My friend M’Phail, the cheery doctor of
the mail-boat, was most untiring in his
attendance; and at last I think professional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
interest in the case was replaced by a deep
and friendly one. Oka’s wife, who has
seen so many cases of fever, and so many
lives allowed to slip through the native
practitioners’ fingers, is unceasing in her
praises of the ship’s doctor, whose skill and
resourcefulness seem to her simple mind
nothing short of miraculous. Indeed, she
almost forgets to give the family god, before
whose impassive figure a light has
been kept burning night and day during
her mistress’s illness, any credit for Mousmé’s
wonderful recovery.</p>

<p>However, when she remembers it, she
in penitence places additional offerings of
fruit and flowers on the little shelf on
which the image stands, and when I go
down to give some order to Oka, I see her
prostrated, in the comparative gloom of
their basement bed-chamber, pouring out
her supplications, whilst the scent of burnt
incense pervades the house more than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>When she hears me she comes out, half
fearing lest I should treat her orisons with
ridicule.</p>

<p>“Him hear,” she says, pointing and nodding
in the direction where the idol sits
solemnly, in a halo of yellow light from
the little earthen-ware lamp. “Missus”—she
has mastered the word, and uses it
with infinite care—“velly much better.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>And who knows, Oka’s wife, perhaps
your prayers offered in good faith have
reached ears that are not deaf, and have
brought an answer from “the God of the
English sir,” I say to myself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p>Mousmé is better.</p>

<p>At last, after weary and anxious days of
waiting and watching, the crisis is past.
From that mysterious land, whose borders
so often touch ours in sleep and illness, in
which Mousmé had almost set foot, my
little wife has returned. A frail ghost of
her former bright self. One who looks as
though she had seen visions.</p>

<p>She seems more fairy-like than ever, sitting
out under the verandah, wrapped up
in an elaborate dressing-gown of silver-grey
silk with a delicate rose-pink lining.
She doesn’t look a whit older—Japanese
women never appear so till they are quite
old—only more like some toy woman
taken bodily from off a screen or jar decorated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
by an artist drawing his inspiration
from models of the highest types.</p>

<p>There seems something almost unreal in
the slight figure in its quaint Eastern
dress, and the dainty ways that are returning
to her one by one with the strength
which comes back so slowly.</p>

<p>Oka’s wife is delighted. She is very
fond of the little mistress, who is so gay
and childlike and amiable. I shall be
sorry when the time comes for us to leave
old Oka, with his ugly, amiable, yellow
face, and his wife, who is, as are many of
the lower-class women, really more than
passably good-looking, though verging
upon forty.</p>

<p>We sit out almost all day long; and
when I am obliged to leave Mousmé to
attend to business in the town, Oka’s wife
sits within call, and Mousmé looks at the
pictures in the illustrated papers and magazines
Lou has from time to time sent me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
or pores over a tattered copy of a rudimentary
English spelling-book and grammar
combined, which Chen Yo, the publisher
of the principal paper, put aside for
me as a great curiosity which he had
bought one day.</p>

<p>Mousmé is learning English well. Her
accent is still peculiar, of course, though
her vocabulary is greatly extended. I talk
to her as much as I can, for soon English
will be the only language she will hear.</p>

<p>These are ever-to-be-remembered days,
spent in my Japanese home overlooking
the wonderful garden, full of brilliance of
flower, earth, life and sky. I smoke, and
Mousmé plays her guitar; and she sings in
a voice into which love and patience have
translated greater harmony and sweetness
than any other woman’s voice that I have
heard during the last four years—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What shall I sing to thee, my love?</div>
<div class="verse">In the garden where the moonbeams play,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
<div class="verse">And pipe the nightingale and dove,</div>
<div class="verse">And plash the fountain’s silver spray.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What shall I bring to thee, my own?</div>
<div class="verse">Visions of heaven’s mansions fair;</div>
<div class="verse">Never had king a truer throne</div>
<div class="verse">Than my heart’s casket rich and rare.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Sing on, little Mousmé; there are
other verses of your little love-song,” I
say.</p>

<p>But she is tired, and, unconsciously like
a European <i lang="it">prima donna</i>, only sings the
last two lines over again—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Never had king a truer throne</div>
<div class="verse">Than my heart’s casket rich and rare.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“True, Mousmé, true,” I say, half to
myself, as the song loses itself in the air.
But she catches the words, and smiles.</p>

<p>The wet season is coming on, alas! before
I can leave, and our evenings beneath
the verandah will be less frequent. It is
not nearly so pleasant indoors, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
damp air is bad for Mousmé. So we play
Japanese draughts, and talk of England.</p>

<p>Sometimes Kotmasu comes in. He is
convinced at last of the <i lang="la">bona-fides</i> of my
marriage, and is as profuse in his apologies
for ever having doubted the success of my
experiment, as he was with his lugubrious
predictions that it would never succeed.</p>

<p>We are always glad to see him; for
since Mousmé’s illness I have been into
the tea-houses, and even the town itself,
very little. We hear gossip from my
queer mother-in-law, but it is usually only
a <i lang="fr">chronique scandaleuse</i> of the doings of the
<i lang="ja">geishas</i>, of her friends, and last, though
by no means least, of her enemies, half of
whom I do not even know by name.</p>

<p>Kotmasu, on the other hand, has always
some scrap of more or less reliable European
news, which, if it does nothing else,
serves as a peg on which to hang a reminiscence,
or an echo to awaken old memories
of Western men and things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The evenings we spend together are far
from being uninteresting; and Mousmé,
who has picked up the art of conversation
wonderfully, is delighted to intrude her
quaint ideas upon us. She is burning with
curiosity concerning the strange country
called England, which Kotmasu, willing
enough to shine even in the eyes of a married
woman, and she my wife, pretends he
knows so well.</p>

<p>He is really very funny in his descriptions
sometimes. In a sense they are fairly
correct; but they are, just like all Japanese
pictures, lacking in the most elementary
perspective. It is not because
his perceptive faculties are lacking, but
only that they follow the national groove,
the worship of the minute to the exclusion
of broader effects.</p>

<p>Mousmé, no doubt with a desire to be in
the possession of two opinions, addresses a
multitude of questions to him when, as is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the case to-night, he is spending the evening
with us.</p>

<p>“What do the women wear? How do
they dress? Are their <i lang="ja">obis</i> as handsome
as mine?” and so on.</p>

<p>Kotmasu endeavors to describe the
attire of my fellow-countrymen, blundering
magnificently over its hidden intricacies.</p>

<p>“It is dull, very dull indeed,” he
explains, with an apologetic glance in my
direction, as if fearful that I should seek
to upset his statement. “There are no
colours worn—at least,” he hastens to add,
with another glance over in my direction
through the tiny cloud of bluish-grey
smoke his absurd tobacco-pipe permits
him to eject, “not colours like ours. Not
like you are wearing, Mousmé.”</p>

<p>I laugh to myself, partially at the perplexed
expression on Mousmé’s face, and
partially at the idea of her promenading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
in England in all the glory of a canary-coloured
<i lang="ja">obi</i>, plum-coloured gown embroidered
in gold thread, and a bifurcated
garment of ivory satin.</p>

<p>“The women wear no <i lang="ja">obis</i>,” continues
Kotmasu, complacently.</p>

<p>“No <i lang="ja">obis</i>!” ejaculates Mousmé, evidently
incredulous.</p>

<p>“No. Sometimes the children do.”</p>

<p>“It is velly stlange,” says Mousmé, “and
they not look velly large here. See!” she
continues, placing her tiny hands as
though to span her waist. “What do they
wear then?”</p>

<p>Kotmasu is launched forthwith into a
veritable catalogue. The garments comprised
in which must be individually
explained for Mousmé’s enlightenment.
Kotmasu, plunging innocently into the
sea of impropriety, at last succeeds in satisfying
her curiosity.</p>

<p>As we rise and step out upon the verandah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
to get a breath of cooler air, she
comes close to me, and taking my hand in
her pretty I-wish-to-be-protected way,
whispers in Japanese, “How strange it
will be! Cy-reel, I am a little frightened;
I feel like the other night when I was
awoke by the <i lang="ja">nidzoumi</i> scampering across
the floor, and squeak, squeaking in the
walls.”</p>

<p>Mousmé is like her Western sisters in
her fear of mice.</p>

<p>“But I shall be there, Mousmé,” I
reply, as she squeezes my hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, Cy-reel;” then with a coquettish
smile, which I can see ere we pass out into
the gloom of the verandah, “perhaps, perhaps
it may be all right.”</p>

<p>It had been raining. Such torrents of
rain! Kotmasu had come up to see us
through it all. A queer figure in an out-of-date
English mackintosh, the rubber as
well as the style of which, he had admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
under pressure of my chaff, had
perished, and a wonderful umbrella-like
hat of huge diameter.</p>

<p>Down all the mountain-paths, and the
steep roads leading into the town, the
miniature torrents ran, as if they must
sweep away the very foundations of the
frail, queer-looking houses.</p>

<p>The harbour was blotted out, the town
obscured by the vast grey masses of cloud,
which, topping the hills they hid, seemed
to fall down their sides into the hollow of
the town.</p>

<p>Mousmé and I, till Kotmasu came, had
watched the scene from the verandah,
waiting for the rifts in the watery veil
which, sure to come sooner or later, would
give us exquisite peeps of indescribable
loveliness.</p>

<p>Now all three of us are standing there
in all the silver glory of Japanese moonlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Kotmasu even is silent, and makes no
further attempt to explain English ways
and customs to Mousmé.</p>

<p>The hillside, with its drenched foliage
and grassy slopes, is like a sheet of frosted
silver. In the foreground lies our garden
set thick with Nature’s flashing, gem-like
rain-drops. The harbour can be seen
again, as usual, an immense black pearl of
irregular shape, with here and there a
streak of moonlight pencilled on its tranquil
surface. The cemeteries and tea-fields
stretched below us to the right and left
are but darker oxidised silver; the temples
and tea-houses but embossed figures.</p>

<p>Down quite below us is the still darker
patch of colouring, immense, far-spreading,
which marks the town; the lights and the
gleam of lanterns look in the damp air
like angry eyes seen in tears.</p>

<p>Few sounds reach us, and even the
cicala’s chirp is far less noisy than usual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Mousmé still has hold of my hand, and I
can see her face glancing upward now and
then.</p>

<p>We might have remained there on the
verandah with the light of the room behind
us streaming out, a warm yellow
patch, for another hour or two, so impressive
was the view, and the silence
which all three of us seemed so reluctant
to break. But suddenly we are startled
by the <em>Boom! Boom—m—m!</em> of the immense
gong belonging to the Shinto
monastery far below us down the mountain
side. Such a noise!—awe-inspiring,
terrific (if there be tone colours, then red,
purple and orange), invading every hillside
cranny, seeming positively to engulf
us in its ever-widening air circles of sound.</p>

<p>“It has spoiled all,” whispers Mousmé,
heaving a sigh.</p>

<p>“Yes, little Mousmé. See, it has even
frightened the moonbeams.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>A dense cloud drags its edge across the
face of the moon, and now all—except the
lights of the town and the few twinkling,
feeble lamps of the ships out in the harbour,
which appear brighter suddenly for
lack of their celestial rival—is dark.</p>

<p>Kotmasu knocks the ashes out of his
tiny pipe bowl with a sharp, metallic tap
upon the bamboo verandah rail, and says:</p>

<p>“There will be another storm soon. I
must be going.”</p>

<p>He says good-night somewhat reluctantly
after all; and when we have
watched him go away down the path, over
the edges of which our poor rain-beaten
tea-roses are straggling, with his big hat,
paper umbrella on which a grinning and
intelligent-looking red dragon is fearlessly
daubed, and an orange paper lantern with
bars and lozenges of vermilion, which the
rising wind threatens every moment to
overturn or extinguish, we go in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Oka’s wife is playing her <i lang="ja">samisen</i> in the
basement, its twanging strains ascending to
us through the thin floor. She is singing
now in a shrill, squeaky voice, perhaps to
amuse Oka, or to lull one of the numerous
little Okas to sleep. The song goes on to
some accompaniment which is too irregular
to be anything save an improvisation, all
the time Mousmé is taking a few of the
most valuable and elaborate pins out of her
hair, preparatory to sleep. My toilet is a
simple one compared to that of Mousmé,
which indeed is so elaborate that I have
frequently caught myself idly wondering
why she ever gets up or goes to bed to go
through such a process. There are her
garments to be carefully stowed away in
her little cupboards, curiously contrived behind
the panelling. The proper folding of
her <i lang="ja">obi</i> is in itself a matter of some considerable
importance, to judge from the serious,
rapt expression of her face. Then there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
are the wonderful pins with which her
pretty head, set so well on her sloping
shoulders, is adorned.</p>

<p>There is no light to put out, because I
always keep the lamp with its glowworm
flame burning throughout the night. It
permits, for one thing, Mousmé properly
to arrange her head in the little hollow of
her camphor-wood pillow; for another, it
allows me to watch her fall asleep, and
the antics of the moths outside our slate-blue
gauze mosquito curtain when I cannot
sleep myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>To-night, however, I am lulled to rest
by the sheer monotony of Oka’s wife’s
song; and the last thing I remember is the
twang, twing, twang of her <i lang="ja">samisen</i>, which
is quite loud now, I have my ear so close
to the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p>This morning we have had a visit from
mother-in-law and the little monkey of an
Aki. It appears that Kotmasu has told
her—and what is more, has made her at
last believe—that we are really going away
to England.</p>

<p>Mother-in-law is unlearned except in the
housekeeper’s art, and this conveys nothing
very definite as regards locality to her
mind. England, Europe even, is as indefinite
a place as the Shinto heaven.
Somewhere out beyond the harbour, which
she can see from our verandah, even beyond
green-wooded Hoyaki and Cape
Nomo, but that is all she knows or can imagine.
We are going away, therefore she
will not be the further recipient of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
“handsome presents” in which her soul
delights. I quite comprehend that this is
the direction her thoughts will take, and it
is really to assure herself that Kotmasu’s
statement is absolutely true that she has
toiled up the hillside in the hot sun so
early in the day.</p>

<p>Why she has brought Aki to the family
council I cannot conceive; but Aki has
brought a tortoise about the size of a silver
dollar, with which he contentedly plays in
the sun on the verandah, where I can see
his funny little shaven head, with its tufts
of black hair, bobbing about, above the
edge of the lower half of our sliding-panel
window as we talk. No doubt he has
brought some fantastically shaped and gorgeously
coloured doughtoy out from the
folds of his outer garment to keep the
tortoise company.</p>

<p>“So you are going away?” says mother-in-law
in Japanese, Mousmé’s efforts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
teach her even a few words of English
having proved quite unavailing.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I reply; “we are going to England
soon.”</p>

<p>I somehow feel as though I were committing
a robbery; and her next remark
serves rather to deepen my disquietude.</p>

<p>“You are going to take my daughter
with you, honourable sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would only require her
whilst you remained in Nagasaki.”</p>

<p>I have never yet succeeded in making
my mother-in-law understand the permanency
of my attachment, and I do not hope
to accomplish the feat now; but I explain,
hinting that there will be “handsome
presents” to all the members of her (for
me inconveniently large) household when
we take our departure.</p>

<p>This, if nothing else, she comprehends;
and she offers no further objection to Mousmé’s
accompanying me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>In many respects I like this queer little
painted doll of a mother-in-law, who has
really wonderfully beautiful brown hair,
and a childish way and smile, notwithstanding
her seven children, and underlying
native rapacity on a small and engagingly
frank scale. So I suggest that Mousmé
and I shall give a farewell entertainment
to my Japanese relations, and this idea
meets with her most cordial approval.</p>

<p>I smile to myself at having mollified her
so easily, and reflect that, as Kotmasu
once philosophically remarked, marriage
was cheaper after all, and I should have
no cash payment to make for permission to
take Mousmé with me.</p>

<p>Mother-in-law is quite content now, and
as firmly convinced as ever that I am a
“velly much rich honourable English sir,”
for thus Oka always describes me. She
insists upon prostrating herself most outrageously,
to the disarrangement of her <i lang="ja">obi</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
on the end of which she unfortunately
steps when she takes her leave, which she
does as soon as she is satisfied that it is
really my intention to ask all my relations
to a farewell <i lang="fr">fête</i>.</p>

<p>Mousmé is, I fancy, a little alarmed at
the prospect; for as soon as her mother
has gone with Aki weeping at her side,
and apparently refusing to be comforted
by his mother’s more or less specious promises,
because of the disappearance of his
tortoise, which has doubtless fallen down
amongst Oka’s progeny through a crack in
the verandah floor, she exclaims in an awe-struck
voice:</p>

<p>“Cy-reel, do you know how many there
are?”</p>

<p>“No,” I am forced to admit.</p>

<p>“They are as numerous as the bees in
the garden.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” I answer resignedly; “we
must do our best.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“They are very strange, some of them,
very strange persons indeed,” she continues,
with a look of surprise that I am
not frightened.</p>

<p>“The more bees, the greater the honey,”
I reply, quoting a maxim that may be hers,
or her mother’s, or one of national adoption.</p>

<p>Her little face—perhaps she is dreading
all the fuss and bother and pain of taking
leave of people she may care for—becomes
more sober than ever.</p>

<p>“But there is a barber!”</p>

<p>I exhibit no surprise.</p>

<p>She takes my hand to prepare me for
the last and greatest shock of all.</p>

<p>“Cy-reel, I am afraid that there may be
a <i lang="ja">sampan</i> boy.”</p>

<p>This is coming down in the world with
a vengeance. But what are the odds?
So I reassure her.</p>

<p>“Mother is sure to let it be known.
Perhaps, even, people who are not relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
may come, people I should not care
to know,” resumed Mousmé, drawing herself
up, and looking ridiculously funny in
her sudden affectation of pride—and after
the <i lang="ja">sampan</i> man, too!</p>

<p>I shall have a queer party, it is certain.
Never mind. Only, I must caution
Mousmé not to mention her uncle the
barber to Lou when we get to England,
nor refer even casually to the brother-in-law
who earns a living as a <i lang="ja">sampan</i> rower.</p>

<p>During the next few days Mousmé is
very busy. She knows, if I do not, what
a superior and lavish entertainment will be
expected of the “very much rich English
sir;” men and women from the town seem
to be clicking our wicket gate after them
all day long, and walking up the path to
the house interminably.</p>

<p>Mousmé has ordered everything which
can in any way assist in confirming their
belief in my importance and wealth. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
<i lang="fr">piéces de résistance</i> of the feast are different
sorts of Huntley and Palmer’s biscuits.
I know well how little Aki’s eyes will
gleam at the mere sight of the sugared
ones.</p>

<p>These biscuits, strange to say, will
stamp the entertainment as one of superior
character. They are, of course, very
dear, and Mousmé knows they will be duly
appreciated.</p>

<p>She tells me in an awed voice that her
numerous relatives will come early and depart
late.</p>

<p>“Will, perhaps, not go until all these
wonderful biscuits have disappeared.”</p>

<p>I smilingly pretend to be very terrified.</p>

<p class="tb">We have entertained our vast collection
of relatives; and possibly more than one
stranger unawares.</p>

<p>What a quaint conglomeration they
proved! How they all could be related<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
still puzzles me; but related undoubtedly
most of them were, from “gilded youths”
(some of Mousmé’s numerous cousins-in-law)
in their bowler hats and other pseudo-European
garments, with the silly faces of
idlers, to the much-feared <i lang="ja">sampan</i> rower,
who proved quite a gentleman in manners.</p>

<p>Mousmé and I received them, and listened
to their profuse compliments, whilst
I, at least, was inwardly amused at their
salutations and kow-towing, performed
even by the ladies on all-fours.</p>

<p>Oka and his wife hand round tiny cups
of tea, equally minute plates of candied
beans, plums in sugar, and cherries in vinegar;
and as our guests’ tastes are satisfied,
they pass out into the garden, gay
with lanterns, and full of music performed
by some strolling <i lang="ja">samisen</i> players whose
services I secured.</p>

<p>These really play well. If only they
would not sing!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>My numerous relatives are in no hurry
to go. But at length, quite late, the last
family has left us, with their lanterns in
their hands and reiterated good wishes
and compliments on their lips; and the
garden is again silent save for the chirruping
cicalas, who, like the poor, are indeed
always with us, the splash of the fountains,
and the hoarse, sepulchral croak, croak of
awakened frogs.</p>

<p>We linger, Mousmé and I, a little while
in the garden, which at the end of the
month we shall give over into other hands,
and then we go in, and Mousmé smokes a
little pipe ere retiring to rest. It took me
some time to get accustomed to the habit,
which seems to afford her such unqualified
delight, but now I am resigned. The
tobacco is so mild, and the little silver
pipe with its thimble-sized bowl looks so
toy-like and innocent; and now I find,
from the papers and magazines Lou sends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
me, that it is becoming quite the fashion
for women and girls in England to smoke
mild and scented cigarettes <i lang="la">sub rosa</i>.</p>

<p>Mousmé knocks out the ashes from her
pipe on the edge of her little ember bowl,
with a metallic pin, pin, pan, and then,
taking off her day garment of plum-coloured
brocade, slips into a dressing-gown
robe of blue linen, with wide sleeves and
an <i lang="ja">obi</i> of powder-blue muslin, which she
knots in the inevitable exaggerated butterfly
bow round her supple waist.</p>

<p>I shall, after all, be sorry to leave this
strange Eastern home of mine, with its
queer noises at the dead of night, and its
fragrant garden, the sweet perfume from
which drifts in and even penetrates
through our blue mosquito-curtain of stout
gauze, when we leave, as we frequently do,
the panels of our outer wall pushed back
for air.</p>

<p>Then there is the trouble of packing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the bother of going through all the letters
and papers which I at first, when home-sick,
commenced to keep because they
came from home, and afterwards because
I was too indolent to destroy them. All
this must be done now, however; must
indeed be begun to-morrow. There are
Mousmé’s belongings, too, which she is
already packing in her mind’s eye in ridiculous
little lacquer boxes, which would be
battered into matchwood ere they were
stowed in the hold.</p>

<p>I lie awake for some time thinking over
all this, and watching the big night-moths
come in through the open panel of the
window, and then flutter round the idol’s
head for a moment ere singeing their poor
soft wings at the flame of the lamp burning
before its placid features. Some of
them are so big that they make quite an
appreciable noise on the white matting
floor when they fall headlong on to it. I
fall asleep watching—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“the deadly gyrations of the poor fascinated things, on suicide intent,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and dream that I am pursued by huge
monsters of moths with heads like the awful
masks I see every day in the curio shops.
And I frighten little Mousmé nearly out
of her wits, just as it is getting light, by
my frantic attempts to escape from my
dream-bred horrors, and the environment
of the mosquito-curtain.</p>

<p>When I am fully awake we sit bolt upright
on our mattress bed, and laugh just
like children; I because Mousmé, with
face screwed up in half-laughter, half-tears,
looks so comical with her eyes blinking at
the light; and she because it is such a
relief for her to find that “Cy-reel is not
gone mad after all.”</p>

<p>Mousmé and I spent the first part of the
day shopping, buying Japanese curios and
native silks and embroideries for those at
home, a very expensive cabinet with whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
nests of tiny drawers for Lou—frankly, to
propitiate her—and European articles
when and where we could get them for
the “handsome presents” of which my
mother-in-law and Mousmé’s numerous
brothers and sisters are so fond.</p>

<p>Mousmé’s dress is an ideal one for such
an amusement as shopping. It is simply
astounding how much she can stow away
mysteriously in the many pockets of her
wide sleeves alone.</p>

<p>Down at Ako San’s, the jeweller, near
the quay, whose shop is a general <i lang="fr">dépôt</i>
for things European, she packs away, I
can scarce conceive where, half the numerous
little purchases we make. I take the
rest; and then loaded, both of us, arms,
pockets and all, we slowly climb the hill
to our home, which is already partially
dismantled in view of our departure.</p>

<p>It has that terrible, painful vacancy of
a house half-deserted. It seems no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to belong to us, as though the ghosts of
possible future tenants already possessed
it. Poor tiny house, which will probably
know Mousmé’s laugh no more!</p>

<p>Whilst Mousmé is wrapping up our
presents in soft, silky textured rice-paper
ready for their recipients, I get together
some of my things.</p>

<p>Alas! when I come to sort my clothing,
I am made painfully aware that when I
land in England I shall be shabby and
out-of-date.</p>

<p>There is a whole pile of European clothing
on the floor near my writing-table, the
sunlight cruelly exposing all its shabbinesses;
but little of it will be of use. I
shall give some of the best of the garments
remaining when I have selected mine, to
Mousmé’s two elder brothers. They will
be delighted even if the things don’t fit.
They possess minds happily unvexed by
such momentous questions as “bagging at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the knees” and “a bad fit about the
back and shoulders.” Happy Japanese
mashers!</p>

<p>At last I have persuaded Mousmé that
her toy trunks and lacquer boxes are no
use for travelling to England. She has
never had anything else, and can scarcely
understand why they will not do.</p>

<p>I have bought her, through the kind
agency of Kotmasu (who is up with us
nearly all day long, now that we are going
to leave so soon), a big trunk—a veritable
Saratoga, I fondly believe—which had belonged
to a deceased lady missionary. Into
this trunk, with infinite care, Mousmé is
placing all her little belongings, packed for
double security in the lacquer boxes, with
storks, frogs and fishes decorating them,
which I had condemned.</p>

<p>Really, Mousmé has quite a respectable
amount of luggage.</p>

<p>This will be something in her favour at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
any rate in sister Lou’s eyes. What a
gorgeous little fairy she will look in all her
fantastic finery!</p>

<p>A possible new owner of the house has
been here this morning; and although he
was terribly polite and ridiculous in his
lengthy-phrased humility and repeated
prostrations, he did not succeed in dispelling
the impression all possible new owners
seem to create, namely, that the old owner
is an intruder whose presence is only by sufferance,
though his lease may not have
actually expired. This attitude of this
one—the man about to take possession—is
a bit of human nature; the same, I found,
in Japan as elsewhere.</p>

<p>We finish our packing at sunset.</p>

<p>Nothing now remains visible in our
bare-stripped home except the things we
retain for our use, which will be packed in
confusion at the moment of departure.</p>

<p>We fully intended to go down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
great tea-house to-night for the last time;
but although we both say we are too tired,
we are in truth both aware that we have
no heart for mixing with the merry throng,
or for watching the <i lang="ja">geishas</i> dancing. So
we go to rest.</p>

<p>“Our last night here,” as Mousmé says,
with a little choked sob. Everything is
now described as “last.”</p>

<p>It is terribly melancholy.</p>

<p>In the morning we go round the garden,
and Mousmé gathers a posy of the choicest
flowers, pink-cupped lotus, gardenias and
roses; she buries her face in it to hide the
tears I know are falling in salt dew upon
the fragrant blossoms. Then we feed the
gold-fish, and watch them poke their red-gold
heads just above the surface, making
rippling circles which widen and rock the
lily-leaves and lotus blossoms. And whilst
we are doing all this in the sunlit garden of
our late home, we can hear Oka’s deep, gruff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
voice giving directions to the men who,
with dilapidated <i lang="ja">rikishas</i> now turned into
hand-trucks, are loading up our luggage to
take it down to the quay and on board the
steamer.</p>

<p>“That is the last,” we hear Oka say in
gruff tones; “mind that the honourable
English sir’s effects are not damaged.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is the last,” says one of the
porters.</p>

<p>“This is the last,” says Mousmé, opening
her hand over the gold-fish pond.</p>

<p>We go up the path to the house in silence;
look sorrowfully into each of the
bare, empty rooms; take leave of Oka,
and Oka’s wife, who is in tears; press a
shining new <i lang="ja">yen</i> into each of the innumerable
children’s hands, even into that of the
brown baby in Oka’s wife’s arms, whose
tiny fist is not large enough to hold the
shining silver, in which it sees only a new
plaything; and then walk away out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
garden of sweet flowers to follow our porters
with the luggage.</p>

<p>Next morning we are to sail soon after
sunrise, and we get up to see the last of
Nagasaki and our home, now a mere matchbox-looking
villa (when seen from the deck
of our steamer down here in the harbour)
perched high up on the hillside, in
company with scores of other similar
abodes.</p>

<p>As we drift out from our moorings in
mid-harbour, we catch sight of it for the
last time, and Mousmé through her tears
kisses her fingers to it.</p>

<p>We wave our hands and handkerchiefs
to those on shore, to Kotmasu, a tiny figure
on the quay, and to the men who have congregated
in their <i lang="ja">sampans</i>, like a flock of
water-fowl, to see the great <i lang="ja">jokisen</i> off.</p>

<p>Then we pass through the narrow neck
of the harbour, with the towering green
slopes of the hills seeming almost about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
fall on top of us, past Hoyaki, out into the
ocean beyond.</p>

<p>Mousmé, who stands by my side all the
time, her hand clutching my arm, gives a
shuddering little sob.</p>

<p>Who can blame her?</p>

<p>With every throb of the engines, every
heave of the huge vessel to the ocean swell,
we are carried farther and farther into
the—for her—unknown.</p>

<p>And it is only the unknown which is
terrible.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
